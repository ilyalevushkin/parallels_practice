The perfect solution for Mac people who have no option but to use a Windows app.....,0
"Great program. A few minor bugs noted, extremely minor detail. If you are looking to switch between platforms with ease and work in a Windows environment you have found the program. Great customer service if you experience any issue. I highly recommend!",6
"Parallels is awesome. If you like plying old nostalgic PC games, and you have just bought a Mac, then this is the right application for you. It works perfectly and is one of the best purchases I have made. It is a little pricy for the top features, but affordable for a one-time purchase, you just don’t get all of the features, like remote access.

Give it a try and you won’t regret it.",4
"it's very good , and use easily",6
Very user friendly and easy to use.,6
Excellent software and the best part is the excellent support given to us during the covid19 situation.,6
"Fantastic software
Smooth integration with OS X, works out of the box. I encountered no problems so far. Fast and awesome. I recommend it !",5
"Excellent tool, a 'must have' for anyone who left Windows but must use it sometimes anyway. Smothlessly integrated with macOS, includes a lot of built-in settings and tools to customize the Windows VM the way you need it. Much (really MUCH!) better than similar VMware Workstation Pro on Windows. Highly recommended and thumbs up to the developers of this wonderful piece of SW!",4
"I had been a Fusion user for many years, and was becoming more dissatisfied  as the years went by. I finally got so frustrated with it that I started thinking of buying a PC. I moved from Fusion to Parallels and I was frankly amazed at the speed and functionality and integration that Parallels offered. It was jaw dropping. I couldn't be happier.",6
"After problems with Catalina and VMware I switched to Parallels. Importing virtual machines WinXP, Win10 was perfect. I'm glad and happy.",6
"Parallels it is the best way to have booth worlds (Mac and Windows) working together. It seems that we are just using Mac. 
The hardware integration it's so simple, even with windows-only devices.
Regarding the technical support, they are very good and very concerned about the problems that the user have to resolve.
Congratulations for the really good software, and congratulations to the Parallels team.",6
"Use Parallels every day for routine tasks. Works as expected! Very simple, the same time powerful! Definitely recommended, for anybody who needs Windows apps on Mac OS :)",6
No complaints,0
Good SW no compromises,0
"Excellent application, easy to use with powerful toolbox.",0
Best shop best product and very helpful,4
Excellent app - quick and easy! Four stars because of problems with the Internet when VPN (with me Windscribe) is active.,4
Excellent! Excellent!,0
"...use Parallels Desktop on Mac OSX. Integrates seamlessly, performance is excellent. Comes with a nice set of tools to go with it.",6
"It should be the norm, but regrettably it isn’t always: a product is developed, tested and released at an appropriate time. I’ve used this product for years. It’s outstanding-totally seamless transition to Windows on a MacIntosh!  No software I’ve used has had the slightest glitch!",6
"It works perfect everyday on an imac pro with catalina. I use it with win 7, win 10 and Mac OS 10.6. perfect solution.",6
Great product. And great tech help getting it loaded onto this not-so-tech old guy's Mac. The really nice feature is the ability to simply toggle between Mac and Windows and not have to reboot for each change in OS.,4
"Better performance than vmware fusion, not thermal throttling in my 2019 15' 6 cores mac book pro, only  one minor issue, it does not automatically adjust screen resolution when I maximize window in my 5k LG display",5
"Parallels are really awesome, very intuitive, fast, easy and show an excellent performance",5
I absolutely love this on my MacBook! Great job development team!,0
Totally Surprised at how well it works with my MacBook Pro. If I'd known I'd have gotten it years ago.,6
Easy to setup and use plus with the copy/paste and inter-machine settings why go anywhere else. The best out there for sure.,4
Excelent way to use Windows related software,6
"Hello, 
Anyone using the Cleaner scan? It wants permission to quite a few things in Security preferences and it bit worrying.
I am a new comer to Parallels after using Virtualbox and Bootcamp and it is so much easier to use. I test software installations in my role at work and create user guides and documentation. I was concerned it might be really slow but it is pretty responsive. 
All the best!",4
"While using of trial version of Parallels I was very pleased to get some experience with it. 

I use Fusion 360 for Mac OS (it's for 3d modelling and manufacturing) and Mach3 for Windows for operating of my CNC cutting machine. The main function of Parallels is to help me to use them together at the same time! Before it, I had to reboot computer every time to create new NC code for CNC.

Another feature was a running Windows from my Boot camp immediately after installation of Parallels, it was very easy to run.",6
"I used the trial version to decide if Parallels was worth the investment.  I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of installation and configuration.  I installed both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04 on my iMac-Pro, with Catalina.  Both worked flawlessly.  

The purchase process was painless, and intuitive.  Ubuntu, of course, is free and downloadable during the install.  Windows is also available to download, but I chose to purchase an OEM version online for $35.  Installing that was also simple and worked perfectly.  Support was available during and after the process, but was unnecessary for me.

So far, my only issue is the fact that it has to be upgraded Annually at a cost.  It’s not hugely expensive and I understand the need to keep current with changes to macOS.

This is a solid product and worth the expense.  I highly recommend it.",6
"Excellent little app, can do some light gaming too",4
It was very easy to renew the parallels license.In a matter of few minutes everything was up and running seamlessly.,1
I think it’s superior in many ways to Bootcamp.  It was not difficult to install it seems to be performing superbly.,6
"Best Parallels yet, easy to use, works with every system I have tried. I love all the added programs that came with Parallel 15. I hesitated to upgrade for the longest time because I have lots of Ham Radio Satellite tracking programs & digital Ham radio software that is used with Windows 10, everything worked flawless. Thanks Again, Alan",4
It works flawlessly.  Seamlessly integrates windows into my mac with very little speed reduction on a windows virtual desktop.,5
Excellent interface and features. Works extremely well and quickly even on an older Mac.,5
Works like a charm.  Very happy with download and performance of program.  Use it with the latest version of OS X and have had no issues.,5
I have used. Parallels since version 3 and experienced some hicups along the way. I am using version 13 on an IMac and version 15 on a MacBook Air. Both have run my minimum requirements very well. I have Active Home Pro to run my X10 system which is about 40 years old and requires Windows but still does a lot of things newer Wifi controller don't do as well. There are a couple of other programs (Video ReDo TV Suite and a Payed version of Photoshop) use in the windows environment that I am totally at ease with so I continue with them.The ToolBox that runs with version 15 has some useful tools that I haven't totally explored.,4
Absolutely one of the best pieces of software I have ever bought.  Seamlessly integrates your OS X platform with Windows as well as any native Linux/Unix OS.  Love this software!,6
"Parallels is the best of 2 worlds !

Apple user since 2005, I have the need from tie time to time to use PC applications, whether professionally (MS Project) or for leisure (PlayChess).
I used to use BootCamp, but it is no longer adequate as it does not support external GPUs such as Black Magic, and the Mac mini does not have enough graphic native power for long sessions of Skype (heat rises in summer below the roof).

Parallels enable me to use the eGPU with the Apple side to cool my Mac mini, and to use PC applications without rebooting while using Mac apps! Works seamlessly and with no dreadful time response. 

A true hit, I do recommend it without a doubt !",4
I'd give you 5+ stars if you could get rid of the annoying message about using Firefox vs Parallels... :),4
"Functional, excellent student pricing and installed in minutes. I spent DAYS trying to get Apple’s Bootcamp to work, which is garbage. Save yourself the time and headache and go straight to Parallels!",6
Parallels is great. It integrates seamlessly with OSx Catalina. It does not slow down my 2015 iMac.,6
"This product amazed me, works precisely as advertised and was one the of the easiest installation and set ups I have done in years.",6
"Parallels is easy to use and seamless.  It allows me to use a software program, that I need for work, which is only available for PCs.",6
Software runs much quicker than old version even on 8 year old laptop. The best way to access Windows! Also an easy to use purchase process.,5
"Slick, easy and stable.",6
"Parallels 15 is excellent. Works really well with macOS Catalina. Windows runs like a dream and the Windows programs run without any issues so far. I use several Astro photography software programs that are Windows only and they run really well.
If you're wondering whether you should pay out for Parallels or use Bootcamp, I can highly recommend Parallels 15 - makes running Windows nice and simple.",4
"One of the great things for me about Parallels is that it enables me to continue to run OSX Snow Leopard as a guest OS on a Mac Pro 5,1 which is now running High Sierra. 

I still need access to Snow Leopard to run Macromedia FreeHand, an old but still highly respected PowerMac application, so that I can access years of archived FreeHand work at any time without having to constantly reboot the Mac into each OS. Despite FreeHand running under the Rosetta emulator in Snow Leopard and, in turn, Snow Leopard running under Parallels installed into High Sierra, performance is impressive and Parallels provides a highly efficient solution in this regard. 

Even with High Sierra running on an SSD formatted with the relatively new APFS file system, Parallels somehow manages to work some magic to ensure that this has no effect on Snow Leopard (which would not ordinarily be able to 'see' an APFS drive). Snow Leopard not only runs fine within Parallels on an APFS drive, but can also 'see' and access files and folders on that drive, which is impressive. 

Of course, you can similarly run Windows as a guest OS within Parallels on a Mac, which opens up a fantastic range of possibilities. All in all, I'm incredibly pleased with Parallels. For me, it does what it says on the tin far better than I had ever imagined would be possible. Highly recommended.",5
A reliable company and a great virtual machine for the Mac OS platform.,0
"Great software that integrates into Mac OS seamlessly, working quickly and updating with no glitches much quicker and altogether better than running BootCamp.",6
I never had any issues.Very easy to run my Unix and Windows.,6
"Parallels works amazingly well. I have a large variety of hardware devices hooked up and working in tandem. 

It makes my MacBook Air the best Windows machine I’ve ever owned!",4
Great program that just works.,0
"Wonderful option for windows users who get their first MacBook and don’t have all the Apple functions straight in their head!
Only issue is switching from one side to the other when printing with USB cord...not intuitive.",4
"If you must use Windows, this is the way to use it. Seamless integration with OSX. Recommended.",6
Excellent product thank you!,0
"Got a Mac ? You can probably find uses for Parallels. Even if you don't need to run GNU/Linux, or Windows, or a miriad of other things - you can run different versions of OS X as virtual machines as well.
There are other ways of running Windows, GNU/Linux, and others on your Mac, but if you value your time, then Parallels is probably the quickest and easiest way to do it. For many guest OSs, setup is mostly automatic - you just set things like memory and disk sizes - and the setup wizard does nearly all the work for you.
Five stars from me.",6
"Parallels on 2020 MacMini

Works great, have 2 x Win10, 1xWindows Server 2012, 2xLinux. Only issue is I bought Pro Version and probably should have purchased Business Edition due to Server2012 R2 facilities I need.",1
I'm using Parallel Desktop for running my principal Windows Program for professional usage since 2010 and with very big Geographical Data manipulation with a very good response and solid execution. Parallel Desktop has an excellent customer support team that you can rely on.,4
best software,0
"Great team, friendly and fast response",0
Great program.  Works seamlessly,0
Love the product! A+++,0
Very Happy with parallels,0
Very nice integration into the macOS environment. Can easily identify which apps are running on which operating system. Love the Coherence feature which more natively integrates Windows apps into the macOS environment.,6
When Catalina blew up Mac compatibility outside of Apple Parallel was the only solution out of those I trialed that was seamless and user-friendly.  The additional toolbox is also a godsend.,6
"Parallels is really up to what is expected of an app or software.
I'm impressed and hope the team will be able to get other apps for other things.",0
Parallels works like a charm.  Easy to set up and runs with no glitches.  It is the perfect solution to running Windows on the Mac,6
"I have used Parallels Software for the past 10+ years and had no serious problems when running on various Mac machines. I am a database developer and used Parallels Software to build commercial databases that ran on Window machines. It was crucial that these databases ran smoothly without any crashes.  Parallels achieved this with flying colours. 
My comrades world wide had very similar results.
Thank you Parallels for your great product and excellent customer service.",4
Love quick swipe to windows. Great software!,5
"The Parallel program for the Mac has come along way since I first bought my first program. It’s now faster ,cleaner, and works very well. I recommend it highly.",6
"I was a long standing VMware Fusion user of many years. After a MacOS update one of my virtual machines failed to start in Fusion. I spent a lot of time trying to trace the problem and couldn't get it fixed. In frustration I decided to try Parallels. I converted my virtual machines and they all worked. Not only that but I was able to run two virtual machines on an iMac at the same time. With Fusion if I ran the same virtual machines on the same iMac it would totally kill the performance of the two virtual machines and MacOS - it was unusable. Not only was Parallels giving me the virtual machine back running that Fusion wouldn't run, but it was also allowing me to run two virtual machines at the same time with no performance drop. So I am now a Parallels customer and I have no regrets. There have been no negatives.",5
Excellent product and so easy to install on a I Mac that I’ve had for eight years. Wish I had done it years ago,6
"Easy to use, easy to set up. Great product",6
"The engineer was really very helpfull and pleasant.

I couldn't thank him enough",0
bad performance with ubuntu 18 and Mac OS,5
Great alternative to Boot Camp. Fast and functional on my MacBook Pro. Can be as integrated or separated from Mac OS as you want. They constantly update as Mac OS updates.,6
"I have to say, this app really does the trick. 
As a hardcore Mac user, I never thought I would ‘really’ need windows. And I don’t, except for 2 reasons. My work requires me to use 2 windows ONLY applications. I’ve tried virtual box and others, and they just cannot compare. Something about Parallels that makes things smooth and efficient. 
Also, the additions of the TOOLkit to provide functions like record screen and resize images is an amazing bonus.",4
Parallels has some of the best support in the World. Their tech is only surpassed by the quality of the technicians.,6
"I’ve used Parallels Desktop Home Edition for about a year.
It was extremely easy to install and easy to migrate my “Boot camp” environment into it.
Parallels provides me with ability to seamlessly work between my Mac OS and Windows environments.
It has enabled me to run an important Windows application while avoiding purchasing an additional computer.",6
Parallels is really easy to use and I'm so grateful for it so that I can keep my MacBook but still able to access the software I need for a PC. No need for two computers....or completely switching to a PC. I love it!,6
"I've used the big name VM environments, VM Ware and Virtual Box. But if you're on a Mac, Parallels is the best. It's way ahead of the competition when providing support for the latest Linux distributions, like Centos 8. And the integration of your Virtual environment with OS X is seamless, automatic and innovative.

For many years they were the only game in town, when it came to running virtual machines on a Mac (even back in the PowerPC days). Though they have competition now, they remain the best.",6
Better than I expected. Easy to use. Flawless transition between operating systems (iOS & WIN10).,6
"After nearly a week of 3-6 hour days trying to get a partition to work on my Mac, Parallels desktop got me to the exact point I wanted to be in a painless 30 minutes. Not only that, but now I can use windows programs on my mac whenever I want and still have all my mac apps open. Genuinely one of the best things I have downloaded. Period.",4
"Parallels is the best software on the market. Running windows 10 on MacOs is really really easy. Not any flaws…All is running smoothly
I just have to say : I love parrallels, don’t even bother to try bootcamp",6
"Parallels works well. Switching back and forth between windows and Apple’s os is seamless  and the free toolbox that comes with Parallels is useful. I rarely purchase add on produces...I made an exception this time.  This was a good purchase. Lastly, for those who want to play Windows games via steam, it works!!!!",4
Works very well and is very stable using Mac as core and Windows 10 in VM,6
"What a fantastic piece of software, I have need of running Windows 10 and XP to support some software not supported by Mac and old software I just can't replace.
Parallels has been faultless, seamless with no issues since the day I installed it. Thank you",4
"Excellent product, running Windows on my iMac. Running legacy windows software, MS Money, no problems. Enabled me to avoid replacing windows laptop or installing Mac, unappealing, alternatives.",4
"Works seamlessly with Windows on my Mac. It boots quickly,  runs fast and accesses all the peripherals. Very happy with its operation. Would recommend it.",5
Excellent VM software.,0
Honestly the easiest piece of software to use. I use on a daily basis as there is software I am compelled to use that does not run on my mac and parallels fires up a fast windows 10 setup in seconds. As a non tech guy was daunted by having to set this up but the process is amazingly straightforward.,6
"I bought Parallels back when it first came out. I was new to the mac and needed to transfer my windows skills but also needed a safe place where i could keep my essential windows apps. I wondered had i made the right choice so tried copies of all the other windows virtualisation software on the market. We are now on the 15th release which is a major rewrite, and provides the mac with a slew of utilities i mostly don't use, the reason is i had already bought into individual solutions form other suppliers. As time passes i find that i am switching to the parallels utils as a cheaper option when upgrade time comes along for the individual apps.
I still use windows XP for some apps and i still use mac mountain lion for others. To me, why throw away a really good utility just because the OS doesn't support it? just keep the old OS and the utility.",4
"If you need to use several Operating Systems or have different versions of say Mac OS x, Parallels does the job well. It runs efficiently and is easy to use and configure. It's integration with the host OS and actual host machine's inputs and outputs is rather seamless.",6
I have just purchased another Mac after 3 years back in the pc world. However I still require windows for some programs. I purchased Parallels again as I liked it previously. However this time I am stoked with coherence mode! It is absolutely smooth in my experience and I love it. Big advance on 3 years ago. Thank you.,4
I have been enjoying the use of Windows programs on my Mac. It has been seamless transitions all these time. Great software at a resonable cost!,6
"The best program to run virtual machine on MAC pc, virtual pc fast and respond to any program on MAC or Windows. Recomended 100%",5
"I use Parallels everyday on my mac for Windows 10 as I have older software that cannot be installed on mac. With Windows 10 in Parallels I still have access to 15 years of financial data. 

Parallels is an excellent sotware.",4
"One of the best application that I use in a long time.  Works great on a Mac
Can switch from Window to Mac with no problem what so ever.",6
"So simple you can’t go wrong. I’m a Mac user; however, you just need Windows ever once in a while. Parallels makes it all happen. Bam. Windows is up and I’m using the necessary software I can’t use on OS. Love Apple, but can’t be stuck. Cheap. Quick. Simple. No brainer. I’ve also used Parallels for over 10 years and still won’t give up my macs!!",6
"I can't live without my Quicken 2007, so Apple killing off the 32 bit Apps was trouble.  Thankfully Parrallels offers a solution. This is fast quick and reliable! setup. This is nothing like the headache I had with Virtual Box over 10 years ago. This is a fast and smooth Virtual Machine.    

I use this on my 13' Macbook Pro that only has 8GB of RAM and it works fine.  If I need more RAM for other projects, I can exit Parallels and restart it later with just a click.

I used iCloud to help bring a lot of my Apps and data over to Parrallels. I also found I could connect a shared folder between the 2 computers. 

I'm hoping to see a Parrallels upgrade in the future when Apple moves to ARM chips.  

I highly recommend this product!",4
"Moving to a Mac, I know I would lose some Windows only apps. I didn't know how much I would need these Windows apps as being a programmer. Because I couldn't use these apps, I would carry 2 laptops, until I found VM software. At first I tried VMWare, and it didnt work the way I wanted it to. Then, I found Parallels. It was easy to install and had great performance. It saved me alot of stress because my Mac and Windows files would be synced across both platforms (and my back thanks me as well).",4
I enjoy my experience and have had no issues.,0
Great app for windows 10 is working,0
Works well. USB pass through works great letting me flash SoC boards from Windows only software.,4
Parallels works seamlessly and doesn't seem to slow down my computer.  I previously used VMware Fusion but it didn't work as well and really slowed down my computer to the point I quit running windows on my Mac.  When I purchased a new Mac I researched the different ways to run windows on a Mac and was impressed with the functionality of Parallels versus the others and I have been completely satisfied with it!,5
"Great system. Extremely robust, fully complimented with features and so transparent. Thanks for just the right solution needed for my situation.",4
Never used a MAC before windows parallels make life easy especially when using MYOB,4
Great Product,0
"The necessity of acquiring a new computer, I needed to upgrade to Parallels Desktop 15. Both of my Windows virtual machines were preserved, fortunately. They run a little slowly, but both are legacy versions that won't be updating. The best new feature (to me) is the ability to create new virtual machines that run various flavors of Linux. This is a great learning tool.

Returning to the Parallels world, I've also installed Parallels Access and Parallels Toolkit. Both are easy and fun to use. It's a kick to control my laptop from my iPhone!

I highly recommend installing the latest version of Parallels Desktop fo Mac. If you must use applications that are only available for Windows, e.g. Microsoft Access or certain project management software, Parallels is the answer. The same would be true for Linux apps as well.",4
"Parallels Desktop 15 is working great for me, I also set up BootCamp, if I need it, as it great to have the best of all worlds, Mac and Windows and more if you want it.",6
"Very smooth experience. Way easier than Boot Camp, so worth a look. I thought the added overhead compared to the BC method would be a problem, but for my purposes, it wasn't. Very good product.",6
Great app. I could no longer use a favorite Bible app because of a 64 bit upgrade. With parallels I can now use it again. Thank you so much,4
"Works Great!  Lots of features, easy to update and lets me use software I still like from older operating systems.  It's like having more than one computer in one!",4
Parallels is such an easy way of running Windows on my iMac Pro. Super easy to install and simple to run. I was skeptical it would be as easy as all of the reviews stated but I’m now a believer. Wow! I would highly recommend Parallels Desktop!!,6
Parallels has worked well allowing me to still use software that is not supported in more recent OS releases.,6
"Parallels is easy to use and intuitive.

Installation is quick and easy. Setting up VM's is extremely straight forward and genuinely take a few clicks to select the OS and away you go.

Integration with macOS is seamless and files can be accessed from the native machine and the VM's interchangeably.",6
BEING ABLE TO JUMP FROM CATALINA TO…WINDOWS 10 WITH ONE CLICK IS TRULY MIRACULOUS,4
"I have the Mac version of Parallels Desktop Pro & it's absolutely brilliant software.  I use RHEL, CentOS, Windows, Mac OS X on my Laptop.  As a Senior Database Admin and Software engineer I work on US Gov't applications requiring high levels of security. 
Parallels allows me to run the same enterprise level software on my MacBook Pro where I can do research, generate documentation, write and test software and configure enterprise level systems in trial runs before going to Production, or when the work environment is inaccessible.  The integration of the host OS and the VM is superb!  Copying/Pasting and sharing files is just easy.  Configuring your VM, tweaking RAM, adding CPUs, networking - is all done through a very intuitive GUI.  
One favorite feature is being able to take snapshots of your VM in different states where you can revert back to a previous state if you later run into trouble.  Parallels Toolbox contains many surprisingly high quality utilities like freeing memory of the host OS, managing screen resolutions for my Retina display, cleaning the drive by removing large files and finding duplicate files.  
Engineering did an incredible job as this software is reliable and very intuitive.  I've not read a single line of documentation yet!",4
Parallels is easy to use and best of all it brings Windows into the Mac world.  I run my Mac and Parallels seamlessly all day in my business and would recommend it to anyone.,6
Great 10/10 works well,0
"I use parallels at home on my Mac and it’s great. Easy to install, doesn’t seem to impact performance, and I’ve really enjoyed being able to play my old windows games.",4
Very useful application.,0
"Great tool and great service, I rely on their tools daily for work and they always deliver.",4
"Nice, but pricey, software solution for virtualization on Mac. Comes bundled with decent remote desktop client and server.

Really good stuff if you can afford it.",4
"I run Linux and sometimes Windows in VMs on my Mac and they run just as smoothly as if they were on dedicated boxes. I use Parallels at work and home, and can't do without it.",6
Excellent software. It has allowed me to use my Mac for both personal (MACOS) and business (Windows) tasks.,0
Works exactly how I thought it would. Very good.,0
"Was easy to install and setup, seamless switching on my mac into Windows 10 and back into mac OS.

Mirrored mac screen to iPad with no issues.

Would recommend for an easy way to run multiple operating systems on a mac.",6
"I take the fact that Parallels just works for granted. But it is a minor miracle that it does. I can get on with job of running essential Windows software without even thinking about how well it integrates with relevant Apple software, which it does flawlessly.",6
I think parallels is so great and it takes the guesswork out of running virtual machines on your Mac. Simple to understand directions and it just works. Love it. If you need to run Windows on a Mac or if you are just used to operating on Windows get this and keep using Windows but on a better computer (Mac)! If you know very little about a Mac you can install Parallels and be up and running Windows on your Mac in less than 30 minutes.,6
Loads quickly and my Mac has no idea it has crossed over to The Evil Empire.,6
Works great no issued,0
"It would be hard to say how much I love Parallels. I'm a developer who has to jump between systems regularly. The ability to work on my Mac and have all of my Windows tools running smoothly is a game-changer for me. I have Visual Studio, SQL Server, and a slew of other heavy hitters running on Parallels Windows. I could do my job without it. But I don't ever want to ever again.",4
"Parallels has thankfully extended the life of our Mac only accounting software for our ad agency after Catalina forced 25 years of smooth AccountEdge software to no longer make a transition to a Catalina version after months of adjusting their engineering to new Apple requirements. So AccountEdge moved on to PC servers and Cloud only options we looked at several versions of software for extreme cost increases. Parallels saved the day and I installed Mojave and am running AccountEdge with no issues as always before. This may extend the life of our accounting software for years, especially at a time it took 2 months to resolve several other complications from the 149 other Applications when forced to a new Catalina system. Kudos to Parallels for such great help in making things simple.",4
Ive used Parallels on a Mac for 7 years now and just upgraded with my newMacPro,0
A very stable and well functioning program. Have been using for 6 years without a glitch.,6
"I have accounting and embroidery software that will work only on Windows OS. I am a Mac aficionado. I have a Dell laptop, but my vision is poor and I have a hard time seeing the details of the embroidery software. I purchased Parallels for my iMac Pro. It was very easy to download and within a shot time I had Windows 10 up and running. Thank you for making things so easy for us Mac users.",4
"As a prior user of another product, I was dismayed at the support I got when I upgraded my Mac. A friend suggested Parallels. I gave it a try and have been an ecstatic user ever since. This application works very well and is quite reliable. Tech support has been excellent. GREAT PRODUCT!",6
"Right what I needed. I was looking for a good option to keep using old Windows XP system on a new Macbook Pro. Parallels desktop was the right solution. And when I had some licensing issue, their service desk helped me very quickly.",6
"Using Parallels as a daily driver to Run my Linux machine on my MBP. Works like a charm, no lags no surprises !",6
This is really easy to use. Neatest VM experience I've ever had.,6
Does what it says & runs smoothly on my MacBook Pro.,6
"It's great how Parallels lets me use my favourite Windows-based programs on my MacBook Pro.  As an elementary school teacher, this facility has come in handy in so many cases from slideshow creation to desktop publishing to AV editing.  Windows also runs faster in Parallels and is not prone to the crashes that may occur in native Microsoft setups.  Highly recommended.",4
"Excellent, easy to use program",0
Great way to add Windows 10 capability to the Mac desktop operating system.,0
"I'm learning the system, but I still get some annoying jumps into presentation mode.  Presentation Mode is not something I need.",4
"I came back to Parallels after quite a few years from when I first used it. It obviously just kept getting better and better. I have some old Windows programs that I still use quite often. I have loaded Windows 7, Windows XP, and a Linux computer with Parallels on my MacBook Pro. I had been using VirtualBox, but with every Mac OS upgrade, it would take quite a while for VB to catch up. The cost of Parallels was well worth having virtual machines that run so smoothly and look so good on my Mac.",6
"Stable, easy to use, well integrated to host Mac OS.",6
"Easy install, best VM software for both experienced users and beginners. Windows 10 VM is exceptionally easy to install, as it downloads everything for you, including the Windows 10 ISO file needed to install the operating system. Also the Parallels Toolbox is amazingly great value, providing essential and helpful little apps to help you be more productive.",6
"Installation and setup was easy, it works and lets me use the handful of Windows only apps easily when I need to.",6
"Good software, making the whole process of emulating Windows easier and without freezing Mac all the time.
Really glad with the purchase and RECOMMEND IT!",6
"I have used Windows emulation in the past and Parallels is by miles the best.   It has allowed me to used software that is only available for Windows on my ageing i7 MacBook Pro and it works perfectly.  In fact that software runs quicker than it does on my office Windows based computer.  You have to learn how to start a session from Mac OS, run apps and end a session but that is straightforward and after that it is plain sailing.",6
Good app.  Does the job.  Heavy on computing power but better than partitioned hard drive to have Windows on a Mac.   Can run Windows and Mac simultaneously especially with window in window feature.,4
Love this program does everything I could ask,0
I've been using various versions of Parallels since 2015 and find it easy to set up and an excellent way of maintaining access to my favourite Windows 7 applications and documents whilst using a MacBook. It's been extremely reliable and it runs Windows 7 in a VM with minimal impact on system speed. Coherence mode makes it easy to swap between Mac and Windows apps with shared clipboard and file storage it's brilliant. Much better than dual booting. I also run Linux in another VM.,4
Registration was a bit tough.  Had to find a previous version of parallels to register which was not on the account I used when I purchased this one.  Luckily I was able to locate the previous version on another account I used prior.,6
Parallels is doing everything that we expected it to do.  We are able to run Windows products on our Mac without any issues.,6
"A great ,simple product but very hard to receive effective backup and information in a timely manner.",4
Easy upgrade,0
"I love Parallels! It allows me to run essential Windows and older Mac OS apps on my MacBook Pro which would otherwise be incompatible.
For such a complex and powerful piece of software, it is comparatively easy to set up and I have virtual machines with windows XP and 10, plus older versions of Mac OS which I can launch easily, & without rebooting.
The 'Parallels Tools' for Mac is a great bonus too, adding powerful utilities to clean up my hard drive etc.
In my opinion, it is also great value for money!",6
"Great Solution, and great support",0
Customer Service was wonderful,0
always helpful,0
Excellent program,0
Parallels works great with my MacBook Pro,0
Easy to use and configure,6
Problem is not fixed,0
I need to use both a mac and pc at my office. Parallels has worked very well to allow access to both on a single machine. Love it,6
"Wonderful product! It easy to instal, intuitive, and has a great interface. It is also quick and stable. An extra bonus is the Parallels Toolbox, which is surprisingly useful. Highly recommended—without reservation!",6
"I really haven't paid any attention to Parallels in quite a while, which is the desired result! I was having likely memory issues with an older Macbook Pro, but not with the new one.",0
Integration with MAC OS is flawless.,6
The new program seems to run slightly slower than before.  More time to open and less easy to move the horizontal and vertical fast rulers to 12 monthly budget months and categories on reports.,5
"The PC side is slow to boot up, but the system runs smoothly.",5
"Easy install and ease of use. One of the advantages of this SW, it allows you to work on both Mac and PC OS without having to shutdown or reboot any of the OS you are running.  Just click on the whichever icon you want to work then you are up and running.",6
It works well with my laptop.,0
One of the best virtualization systems available. If you don't want to mess around with configurations and just want it to work out of the box Parallels has you covered.,4
"Parallels is top quality stuff. As a software developer who has to work across multiple platforms, Parallels allows me to run Windows and Linux software on my MacOS laptop, with excellent performance and commendably reliable results. I can, if need be, run software from all three platforms at once, without using up too many system resources. That's a priceless advantage!",5
"Parallels is a fantastic, fast and stable way of use windows on a Mac. It's good for both gaming and pro applications. Can't recommend it more.",4
"excellent application, very reliable",0
"The Parallels team is results oriented for the benefit of their customers.

Thank you",0
Works very well (as always) with excellent technical support.,6
Parallels allows me to smoothly use my Windows 10 alongside MacOS. The experience overall has been amazing. The best part is I can use Parallels with MacOS SideCar to allow me to use Windows 10 on iPad wirelessly with my Apple Pencil.,4
"I have been a VMWare user for many years.  I found some issues with using VMWare particularly with Linux.  That is when I decided to give Parallels a try.  I can say now that I have lived with Parallels for a while now, I am completely satisfied with how it works.  It's performance is head and shoulders better than VMWare.  It's way of dealing with disk space is wonderful.  I am a happy camper!",5
It runs a Windows application better than Windows does.,6
works ok but each update contains more bloatware and forced upon features. Focus less on the gimmicks and more on the software itself. e.g. latest updates cause the screen to flicker and have all sorts of glitches - solved by reinstalling parallels tools- the updates should automatically run these updates o r users should be notified to run them - instead we are left to fend for ourselves with a crapshoot for support,4
Great and stable product.  Lots of add-ons.  Moved from another software package and am very happy with parallels.  Customer support of great as well.,6
Windows on Mac doesn't feel like a hack anymore. Parallels is very easy to use and it works flawlessly. I love the shared filesystem by default and having the Windows applications icons in the macOS dock! Truly awesome!,4
I have used boot camp and virtual box for quite a while.  Each of which has its specific challenges.  Parallels is by far the best option that removes all of the barriers experienced with the other options.  The integration is seamless and i sometimes forget that i am not on my mac desktop.,6
"Works great with my Mac, love having the option for window programs",6
Excellent and functional. Well worth the investment to make your life easier!,0
"Parallels is arguably one of the best softwares I have ever used in my life, I dislike the MAC interface and this allows me to use the interface I love! Thank you Parallels team! You guys are Rockstars!",0
Great idea and superb implementation! Being able to swipe to another OS feels like a superpower every time I do this.,6
I like how Parallels works it is just so convenient!,0
Resetting worked. It should of been the first thing to try. Upgrade of Windows.,6
"Wonderful experience,...",0
Outstanding product.  Allows for seamless integration of Window and macOS environments.  Much better than previous versions. Highly recommended.,6
works great right out of the box with no steep learning curve. haven't had any issues at all. Using the program in a production environment to work from home since 11th of March.,6
faster! faster!,5
This software gives me all of the capabilities of the Windows environment under the safety and convenience of the Mac Environment.,4
Thanks you as always,0
No issues. Works well,0
I can play age of empire !!! How nice,4
I would rate parallels much higher if it provided adequate product documentation.  There seems to be a blizzard of options which are not discussed in any manner,4
Each edition gets faster!,5
It is quite nice feature to boot from Bootcamp disk without rebooting from it. From Mac OS you can see anything in it.,4
Easy to set up!,6
"I've been a user of Parallels since v3.x and can't express enough how important Parallels has been for me.

For years working in IT, Parallels has provided that bridge between MacOS and Windows that would otherwise involve portable storage (e.g. USB sticks), which is far from secure.

Running Parallels fixes that, meaning you can plug in an NTFS volume (external HD, USB stick etc) and write to it directly from MacOS (via a virtual 'shared' drive between OS'es), rather than being limited to Read-Only. This is a massive efficiency gain.

Parallels has meant I can continue to work in MacOS for the past 12+ years, despite being in Windows Enterprise environments. The added benefits of 'Snapshotting' my Windows installs also means I can use Parallels in a software testing environment, which runs the risk of corrupting a Windows install. Rolling back a snapshot in Parallels returns my 'guest' operating system back to a working state in a matter of minutes.

Nowadays I'm spending more time in photography, and I can use some specialist apps that are Windows only (such as Deep Sky Stacker for astrophotography) without having to transfer hundreds of images between a Mac and a PC.

Parallels has gone from strength to strength and is an integral part of my digital life.",4
A great product at a reasonable price.  I love it and use it often.,1
"I love using Parallels Desktop, especially since I'm new to using an Apple laptop, and some of the apps I like to use are only on Windows. I only needed some help with getting Windows setup as Parallels was pretty easy to follow. I also installed their Toolbox app. It has quite a few tools that I use daily (Capture Area is my favorite, Clipboard history is also nice, and Record Screen lets me save some of my favorite video clips from online). The only thing I wish Parallels included was a copy of Windows, which I didn't know I needed a license for (Easy enough to download from Parallels Desktop on setup), but my husband is an IT guy and took care of it for me. Definitely recommend Parallels for anyone using an Apple laptop, which a saying a lot since computer and me don't mix, but I'm slowly changing my mind.",4
"Excellent 
for many years I have used with pleasure",0
"Always works well for me. Has for years. Don't use the Tools much, but it is great to have a good PC emulator on my Mac.",6
Great application to allow me to acces & run my Windows apps from my Macbook Pro one by one,4
Works well majority of the time. Occasional issues with mouse cursor not tracking and needing a program restart. But overall very satisfied.,4
"I am happy with the way parallels is performing on my mac
Thank you.",0
"Excellent, useful and essential. I am very glad that I connect it up with parallels. I look forward to exploring more

Michael",0
Works flawlessly on my MacBook Pro,0
The new parallels seems faster and more reliable.,5
thank you for the great support !,0
Parallels works great and customer support is excellent. I highly recommend Parallels.,6
"The installation of the Parallels program was straight forward.  I needed a VM environment on my new iMac using Catalina OS to house an old '2007 Quicken for Mac' program in an El Capitan OS.  I did not want to abandon 16 years of data to try to fit into (or misfit) the latest Quicken App.  I found that on the whole, it is doing what I need to continue to add data to the App.  I'm living with some peculiar issues such as that I no longer be able to use Quicken's native backup.  Every time I do, I lose recently entered data.  I conclude after working with Quicken experts that it might be a Quicken problem that they no longer support.  So I just rely on Disk backup on the Mac.  Hoping that is adequate.  Then there is the issue of shutting down Parallels.  I found that if I shut down the VM, I will lose data in Quicken as well.  So I must do no more than  minimize or suspend Parallels, when I turn off the computer.  It give me pause when recently Parallels offers an update.  Should I shut down the VM and risk losing data for the update?  I'm learning to live with the corkiness of the situation.  By the way, their tech support is great, very responsive and knowledgable.",4
I use Parallels to run multiple operating systems for personal testing and review.,6
"Been using Parallels for years! It’s solid and reliable,",0
Love the program. Had very quirky problems that turned out to be a defective SSD and not Parallels. Support tired to help several times.,4
My brief interaction with the customer service department has been outstanding,0
"Samuel Kelly, not Samuel Kelly Kelly. I like Parallels 15.",0
Very helpful software package that allows me to test MS-Windows packages and Linux on my Mac.  Highly recommended.,4
"The only thing I was disappointed in was that I followed the Parallels recommendation to upgrade to Windows 10 and the performance is so very disappointing and frustrating. I had Windows 7 and so I needed to, but I hope that Parallels can get faster on Windows 10. I have a relatively new and fast computer - an iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017), 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7, 40 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 of RAM - this should not be acceptable. I hope future upgrades to Parallels improves this. Thanks for asking.",5
I use Parallels Desktop for many years to analyze research data that is inaccessible from my Mac.  Being able to use Windows and Mac applications together saved my work.,4
"Parallels just works. It implements a platform that more closely complies with the ideal PC than many hardware PCs. As a result, Windows applications running on Parallels are usually more reliable than they would be when running on a PC whose manufacturer has their own idea of what the platform should be.",4
"The software works better than expected and was easy to set up. Awesome, haven't had a single problem.",6
Parallels has changed my life!  My productivity level has increased now that I have easy convenient access to windows programs on my Mac.,4
"I have used Parallels for many years, I have not had issues with the interface, upgrading the MacOs has not been a problem with maintaining my Microsoft license.
Works well, no issues with any programs to date.",4
"Hello! - You can work simultaneously in OSi and Windows using Parallels software.  Instead of using Windows for MAC in which you would need to boot the MAC computer for each operating system, you can install Parallels software and then install Windows for PC in Parallels along with your other windows software.",4
"Great product, fast and easy to use",6
They give a great service. Thank you so much for,0
Simply the best built for mac.,0
"Parallels is a great way to gradually migrate from one computer to another. I've used it to ensure everything on my old XP machine was captured on my Mac. And now with potential loss of older video formats when updating to Catalina, I have a virtual Mojave machine to fall back on if I find a non-converted file.",6
Works well with macOS Catalina.,6
Great well organized website. Very easy to navigate.,0
Great product. Easy to use.,6
Works well. No trouble yet.,0
Excellent program,0
This Product is brillant,0
"Technically speaking I found the install simple and without an issue.

Seeing you make a new version every time Apple updates OS I wish you could give us retired seniors a lower reduced update price!",6
"On MacBook Pro 16 
Age of empire work like a charm",4
"I really like the way Parallels now lets me quickly and smoothly go back and forth between Windows and Mac OS applications, including copying and pasting!",4
Very easy to use,6
Very efficient and easy to use.,6
Easy to use and it just works.  I've had up to 7 different operating systems installed at one time and Parallels has always performed wonderfully.,6
Excellent service and product,0
"Super easy to install and use. I use it for MS Excel and Access. I’ve been wanting to switch to a Mac for quite a while and finally got one about a month ago. The issue was with MS Access which does not work on MacOS, I have years worth of data and migrating to a new database would have been a real pain. So still stuck with my trusty old Dell just for Access. 

A friend of mine recommended Parallels. I downloaded and installed a trial. The instructions were easy to follow and within an hour or so I was up and running with Windows and Access on my Mac. It is a little expensive but its  worth not having to lug around 2 laptops!",4
I've reviewed Parallels before and nothing has changed. I rely on it to run Windows and legacy software on my Macbook Pro.,6
Knowledgeable and polite.  Thanks for the support.,0
Like being able to message via Facebook; quick and helpful replies!,4
Parallels does exactly what I want.,0
"Smooth interaction between both operating systems if you must use some windows only programs. 
Watchtower Library only in Windows format so a must for me. Works Great. 
Thank You",4
Just your usual excellence.,0
Works flawlessly.,0
It simply works.,0
"everything works as advertised, the setup and the user experience is easy and flawless. I'm not a big MS user but when I need to use MS and especially the DVD it works great.",4
"I've had an exceptionally good experience using Parallels on my Mac. Granted, I don't really use any of the complicated stuff but I have to run a specific Windows program (TOAD) to do my database work and I've had no issues at all using the Windows 10 PVM.",4
"Parallels is great!
I have Windows 10, Ubuntu and Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard with PPC emulation through Rosetta) all running on one machine. 
It's like magic!",6
The software is reliable.,0
Great product.  Works as needed.,0
No issues running Mojave and Windows 10 under Catalina. Operation is smooth and runs with good speed.,5
Fast and easy to use.  Does everything I wanted it to do.,6
works Seamlessly for what I need,0
"Use this application for about 6 years already. It never let me down. The only problem is, it may become sluggish at times, but I suppose it is because of the size of the files I use. Guess, I would have the same issue on a Surface.",5
Unable to get through to customer support to renew my subscription. Updated my payment details but Paypal not working on their website. The website doesn't work properly and keeps redirecting me to the same 'help' article that doesn't help.,1
"Followed the student discount offer on their site and was asked to upload a document with proof of Institute Student Number Photo and Name. Sent this and received an e-mail saying they needed to confirm my 'status'. I did not understand what they meant by this. I further sent screen grabs of me signed into my College and also an e-mail from my Tutor form that week about that week's lesson.
They then sent an e-mail saying I was not eligible as had exceeded upload limit. 
Why bother with a student discount if you do not want to honour it for half of these people. 
Total joke",1
"It is a terrible product. I worked with v10 and later purchased v12 by hoping it would work better. But none works properly on both my old and new macs. Briefly:

- Not proper network connection
- Terrible resolution settings. 
- Slow and sluggish performance",4
