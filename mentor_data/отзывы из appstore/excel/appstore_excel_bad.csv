Dr. Robot [001],Make Excel on iPad OS the same as on Windows 10,"Here we are again, and here I’m saying the same thing with these as usual. I know how hard it is to build these things, but this is just awful. Why are the Office apps so neutered on iPad OS? This platform has so much potential, but apps like this just ruin it. Is this done on purpose? I love Windows 10 and how Office is implemented there, why can we not have the same experience here?
There is no reason.
My 15 year old IBM ThinkPad X41 running Windows 10 1709 with Excel and all the other Office apps flawlessly… beautifully compared to what ever MS is putting out here on iPadOS. It’s really just such a shame. Kind of makes me just want to switch to a Windows based 2 in 1… is that the plan Microsoft?
Where are more than half of the features that are available on the desktop? Don’t you have some unified code base? That’s the only reason I can image these versions being so vastly separate. Make it one!!!
Please fix this, you’re doing such a great job on your own platforms, but here… having no Office apps would be better than this.",Make Excel on iPad OS the same as on Windows 10,"Here we are again, and here I’m saying the same thing with these as usual.

Floatsflyer,Miserable app,"I have 30+ years experience using the desktop version of MS Excel on Windows based PCs. Consider myself fairly proficient. iOS version on iPad looks like, but does not function like, Windows desktop version. First, it appears to be web based so there is serious lag time between attempting to make changes and seeing your attempt appear on-screen. Second, I have spent last ten minutes attempting to copy three adjacent cells (two with numbers and third with formula adding them together) then pasting them into several rows directly below them. Highlight the three cells, long press then tap Copy, highlight group of cells below, long press then tap Paste and what happens? Those three Copied cells are not Pasted but instead one cell shows contents of last item (a cell description) I Copied from a website. Tried four times, same result. Very frustrating.
