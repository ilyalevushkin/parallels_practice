Rolf 48,Excel is good - really .....,"Hello everyone who uses Excel,
So I was asked to rate to put Excel and I really like this program.
But the slim version that is in Office 365 and is adapted for iPad, it is really lousy. Really useless as excel. It is an attempt to integrate a lot of fragments from several more Office products.
It would have been much better to try to keep the body of excel so you recognized yourself. Of course, I understand that you have to reduce the scope of the program's original size, but not in this way.

Så blev jag ombed att betyga sätta Excel och egentligen tycker jag bra om detta program.
Men den slimmade version som finns inom Office 365 och är anpassad för iPad, den är är riktigt usel. Riktigt oanvändbar som excel. Det är något försök att integrera en massa fragment från flera flera Office produkter.
Det hade varit betydligt bättre att försökt ha kvar stommen av excel så man känt igen sig. Självklart begriper jag att man måste minska omfånget på programmets originalstorlek men inte på detta sätt.
