ocrho,"Since Corel acquisition, only as subscription software for Linux users","On December 20, 2018, Corel took over Parallels. On January 21st, 2019 the first update appeared under the new owner. This version 1.4.0 abolished the free use for Linux virtual machines. After the update to version 1.4, a start screen welcomes you to enter a registration. Why do I have to register if an app-in purchase should also be possible via the Mac App Store?
The price of 79 € per year does not fit and represents a much too big leap from formerly free of charge. Fortunately, there are alternatives that offer your software free of charge or continue to be offered as purchase software. A license with no time limit is existential, because subscription software usually only works with the latest hardware and operating system and then you are quickly locked out.
If the new owner Corel acts so hard and does not think it is necessary to communicate this to the customers beforehand, there will be further unpleasant surprises in the future. This is no longer a partner for the common future. I have now uninstalled the program.",Seit Übernahme von Corel nur als Abo-Software für Linux-Benutzer,"Am 20.12.2018 hat die Firma Corel das Unternehmen Parallels übernommen. Am 21.01.2019 erschien das erste Update unter den neuen Besitzer. Diese Version 1.4.0 schaffte die kostenlose Nutzung für virtuelle Linux-Maschinen ab. Nach dem Update auf Version 1.4 begrüßt einem ein Startbildschirm zur Eingabe einer Registrierung. Wieso muss ich mich registrieren, wenn ein App-in-Kauf auch über den Mac-App Store möglich sein soll? 
Der Preis von 79€ pro Jahr passt nicht und stellt einen viel zu großen Sprung von ehemals kostenlos dar. Zum Glück gibt es Alternativen die Ihre Software kostenlos oder weiterhin als Kaufsoftware anbieten. Eine zeitlich unbegrenzte Lizenz ist existenziell, weil Abo-Software funktioniert im Regelfall nur mit aktueller Hardware und aktuellen Betriebssystem und dann ist man schnell ausgesperrt. 
Wenn der neue Besitzer Corel so hart durchgreift und es nicht für nötig hält, dies den Kunden vorher zu kommunizieren, dann wird es in der Zukunft weitere unschöne Überraschungen geben.
