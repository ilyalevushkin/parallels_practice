Sypresz,Pity! Get awake with your ABO software,"After reinstalling on my iMac, I found that I now have to subscribe. So far, you only had to pay the purchase price for the Lite version if you wanted to use the software as the basis for a Windows installation. The program could be used free of charge as a virtual machine with macOS or Linux. That's enough of that. After installing the current version 1.4.0, the app inevitably prompts for registration or payment. The only option is a free test for 14 days.",Schade!

The problem was VMWARE… I have Fusion 8.5.8 on High Sierra and (unbeknownst to me) it had just blew out the VM I was trying to convert. Fortunately, it wasn’t anything important.

DonQuixote2000,macOS VM a disappointing experience,"Disappointed with trial experience with v1.4.0, running macOS Mojave on both host and guest VM.  In VM:
1. trackpad not properly detected (instead it is detected as a mouse), so cannot perform normal trackpad gestures, such as zooming, page fwd/back paging, smart zoom, force-click, etc.
2. scrolling with trackpad works, but is very fast and jumpy, (even with mouse scroll speed set to min.), and does not support inertia.  This makes using most apps, including Safari, very difficult.
3. Touch Bar not detected:
    * Can’t use keyboard/shortcuts settings to configure app to show full set of function keys
    * By default, F10 adjusts mute/unmute, must go into settings to configure to treat as function keys
4. It seems GPU acceleration is not supported, so you end up with corrupt safari tab titles, and apps may malfunction (such as those built on Electron) unless you can run them in a mode that disables trying to use GPU.  Parallels says this is a limitation of macOS.
5. The App Store license for Parallels Lite currently (2019-12-13) says you can install the sw to run VMs other than Windows, but Windows VMs require paid subscription.  However, it seems in reality you cannot run ANY VMs without a paid subscription. 
It seems that a product for Mac would better support Mac features on a Mac VM, but it seems that Windows support might be better for some of these features.  Also, when I tried to get these issues addressed several times with support, they would quickly respond, but we never seemed to solve any of the problems - they would just keep asking me to re-install the tools, generate a technical report, etc.  At one point, they even told me Parallels Lite doesn’t support Mojave (which I don’t think is true, as the the 1.4.0 release notes in the App Store say “Ready for macOS 10.14 Mojave”.
While it doesn’t seem that Parallels crashes the macOS host like some competitor’s products do, and it is great that Parallels provides an app-store (and therefore sandboxed) product, there are still some serious problems with this version (1.4.0).",macOS VM a disappointing experience,"Disappointed with trial experience with v1.4.0, running macOS Mojave on both host and guest VM.
