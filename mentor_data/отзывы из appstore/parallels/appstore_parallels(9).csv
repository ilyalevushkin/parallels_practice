RichardGWood,Unable to upgrade via Lite,"I used the 14 day trial to test this out, and was pretty impressed. It allows you to work seemlessly between mac and windows applications. I was impressed enough to upgrade to the annual subscription.

TinBridgeNikki,WHICH subscription plan???,"The two subscription plans offered are:
• FREE, which specifies Linux only, and
• TRIAL, which specifies 14 days of free use for virtualizing Windows, followed by a paid subscription.
The problem is, I don’t want to do either of those things. I want to virtualize Snow Leopard Server on a separate partition on my Mac (currently running El Capitan). Obviously, Parallels Desktop Lite can do this, because Snow Leopard Server is one of the operating systems listed. However, neither subscription option even mentions Mac OS virtualization. The user’s guide, knowledge base, and forums failed to be remotely helpful. So…
Can this application do what I need done? If so, which subscription plan is the correct one? If not, why is Snow Leopard Server listed? Honestly, the documentation leaves a lot to be desired as it only talks about virtualizing Windows. A little help?

DamionB,Needs Full version with app store licensing,"Parallels is an amazing program. It’s unreal how easily it manages to allow you to run Windows programs on your mac. 
The problem that I have is with the licensing. 
Parallels Desktop Lite is missing quite a few features from the full version of Parallels, which is available outside the mac app store for a one-time purchase price of $79. However, that only gives you one license, so you can only use it on one computer. The nice feature of Parallels lite is that you can run it on all of your computers… but then you lose the features of the full version. 
They need to just make the full version available from the app store. Frankly, I don’t understand why they even created a “lite” version.

TheBear😎,Thanks but no thanks!,"I have run both Lite and the full edition on my 2017 iMac along with High Sierra and have decided to not stick with either variation of this app. The reason is basic. If you have less than 32 GIGs of RAM you could be in trouble, especially if you do graphics or large books.The RAM used by having two Operating systmes running at the same  time is excessive. Running 16 GIGs of RAM with both Systems running, your usable RAM will often drop to below 6 Gigs…that is with no other apps running! The app itself is spectacular, especially the full version! The support is very good, patient and quick to respond. The lite version is really good, but I’d strongly reccomend the full instead.

Support asked me if I had folloowed the RAM settings as suggested. I did and the RAM usage problem persists. I was not going to continue this review but now that I was asked let me continue. I had tremendous problems with the full version and High Sierra 10.13.4 utilizing Boot Camp on SSD. The app and Windows installed after a couple of problems were resolved. The real problem began after restarting from Windows back to the Mac partition. Restart resulted in a GRAY SCREEN on the Mac side. This could not be overcome despite much advise and help from Apple Support. Eventually the SSD had to be REFORMATTED, not just erased and had to return to Sierra 10.12.6 in order to install Windows 10 and Boot Camp. This saved a tremendous amount of RAM! And increased functionality! If you use High Sierra 10.13.4 I do not advise using Parallels and Windows 10 on an SSD.

I’m wondering how well this app will be maintained. It has seen a few updates in the past year, so there seems to be at least some development efforts from the Parallels team.

名前なんて単なる記号です,Hard-to-find requirements: Late 2011 or later Mac,"Follow the link ""Parallels Desktop Lite Support"" in the upper right corner,
In the FAQ, the answer to What are Parallels Desktop Lite system requirements? states only See KB123800.
Detailed operation requirements are written in the linked Knowledge Base article,
In the hardware requirements in it, there is a description ""Late 2011 or newer Mac"", that is, the Mac body of Late 2011 or later is required.
Certainly, Mac Pro and Mid 2010 do not work even if the OS is High Sierra, and it doesn't work, and Mid 2012 works.
It is not based on the hardware architecture, but based on the manufacturing year.
Perhaps the purpose is to eliminate the core 2 generation body uniformly, but
It's unreasonable that the architecture is almost the same in the Core i generation, and the CPU is Xeon, which is good at virtual processing, but it works with Mid 2012 of Mac Pro and does not work with Early 2009 and Mid 2010.
2018/Jan/07 Added
Thank you for your detailed answer.
I see, it is Apple's responsibility to prevent HyperVisor, which is the basis of this application, which is implemented in MacOS itself from operating in a main body of Late 2011 or later.
If there is a supplement for the operation requirements, could you also describe it in the app description on the App Store?
Information in right column: Compatibility...",見つけにくい動作要件:Late 2011以降のMac本体,"右上にあるリンク、「Parallels Desktop Liteのサポート」をたどって、
FAQの中の、What are Parallels Desktop Lite system requirements? の答えに、See KB123800.とだけ書かれている。
リンク先のナレッジベース記事中に詳しい動作要件が書かれており、
その中のハードウェア要件に、「Late 2011 or newer Mac」と記述があり、つまり、Late 2011以降のMac本体が必要なのである。
確かにMac Proでも Mid 2010ではOSがHigh Sierraでも「互換性がありません」と怒られ動作せず、Mid 2012だと動作するのである。
ハードウェアのアーキテクチャで判断しているのではなく、製造年度で判断しているのである。
おそらくCore 2世代の本体を一律に排除するのが目的なのだと思うが、
アーキテクチャがCore i世代でほぼ一緒なのに、しかもCPUは仮想処理が得意なXeonなのに、Mac ProのMid 2012だと動作して、Early 2009とMid 2010で動作しないのはあまりにも理不尽だと思う。
2018/Jan/07 追記
丁寧なご回答ありがとうございました。
なるほど、このアプリの根幹をなす、MacOS自体に実装されているHyperVisorがLate 2011以降の本体でないと動作しないようにしているのはAppleの方だ、ということですね。
動作要件で補足がある場合は、App Storeのアプリ説明にも記していただけないでしょうか？
右欄の情報：互換性の部分に「OS X10.11.5以降、64ビットプロセッサ」と表記されているだけでは、2017年3月6日付のNorthernstoneさんのレビューのように、本体年式で制限されている方々が「自分のMacではどうして動作しないのだろう？」と悩み続けることになります。私もその一人でした。
以下はParallels様へではなくAppleへの意見というか愚痴になりますが。
2017年末のiPhoneの件でAppleは、
「お客様による製品の買い替えを促すために、私たちが意図的にApple製品の寿命を縮めたり、お客様の体験が損なわれるようにしたことはこれまでに一度もなく、今後も決してない」
と言っているようですが、
ハードウェアには動作する能力があるのに、発売年度だけで新OSやその構成要素の一部動作を制限するのは、意図的な製品寿命の短縮・体験の損失ではないというのでしょうかね？",4.00,JP,1.3.0,2018-01-07T05:54:33,False,False,231803575432,231803575432,"Parallels Desktop",1085114709,apple,0,231803575432LuEbJAOcbagyXLrdhrTIpTQ,ja
