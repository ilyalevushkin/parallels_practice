Bought the product with only one need: connecting an external HD to my Mac.
Spent hours reading all the support pages when it didn't work. Tried everything and it still didn't work.
Reached out to Parallel's customer support asking for a call, that portal doesn't work.
Emailed customer service saying I would like to speak to a person and not get an email of support pages, then I got an email after business hours with the support pages I asked not to get, and then the case was closed because it was a weekend.
Reached out again via chat this time and the agent wanted remote access. I had to convince him he needed to call me first. Begrudgingly he did. 
Spent 3 hours of wasted time as he experimented and found it still wasn't working.

Received and email at the issue was not resolved. When I inquired further I was told I should wait for the next build.
I asked for a refund or at least that the subscription start from when Parallels worked out their program and I was just directed to Apple support.

cmarinas,Best option for Mac OS X (when it was free),"I'm only interested in running Linux occasionally in a guest on my Mac and it seems to be significantly faster than VirtualBox (at least when it comes to handling the retina display). Taking a star off as the lastest update requires a yearly subscription, although I've been given 1 year trial as an existing user (thanks!). I have a year to think about, try other options, but it looks like buying Parallels Desktop directly (one-off payment, possibly with the occasional upgrade) is still cheaper than the Parallels Desktop *Lite* subscription (from which Apple probably grabs a bing chunk).
EDIT: I don't really get the pricing. There is a £73.99 yearly subscription for the ""lite"" version when you can get the full desktop version (with a few additional features like bridged network) for £69.99 with a significant discount for subsequent upgrades. I guess the higher price here is just for App Store share. When the free year ends, I'll go for the proper Parallels Desktop and uninstall the lite one.",Best option for Mac OS X (when it was free),"I'm only interested in running Linux occasionally in a guest on my Mac and it seems to be significantly faster than VirtualBox (at least when it comes to handling the retina display). Taking a star off as the lastest update requires a yearly subscription, although I've been given 1 year trial as an existing user (thanks!). I have a year to think about, try other options, but it looks like buying Parallels Desktop directly (one-off payment, possibly with the occasional upgrade) is still cheaper than the Parallels Desktop *Lite* subscription (from which Apple probably grabs a bing chunk).
EDIT: I don't really get the pricing. There is a £73.99 yearly subscription for the ""lite"" version when you can get the full desktop version (with a few additional features like bridged network) for £69.99 with a significant discount for subsequent upgrades.
