sphuh,Incorrect update to 1.4.,"With the update to version 1.4.0, the application's use policy appears to have changed radically: now it seems mandatory to subscribe to a subscription, even if with a free trial period. The negative opinion is linked to this radical change that is not adequately highlighted.
I believe that version 1.3.0 was an excellent application for those who, like me, need to use a linux virtual machine and do not intend to install windows. The ability to quickly create a linux virtual machine quickly and without problems, together with the fluidity of operation, was an incomparable advantage compared to other solutions. This sudden change of ""style"" will certainly put many users in difficulty.
I hope some clarification will come from the developer.",Aggiornamento a 1.4 poco corretto.,"Con l’aggiornamento alla versione 1.4.0 la politica di utilizzo dell’applicazione appare cambiata radicalmente: adesso sembra esser obbligatorio sottoscrivere un abbonamento, anche se con un periodo di prova gratuito. Il giudizio negativo è legato a questo cambiamento radicale non adeguatamente evidenziato.
Ritengo che la versione 1.3.0 fosse un’ottima applicazione per chi, come me, ha la necessità di utilizzare una macchina virtuale linux e non intende installare windows. La possbilità di creare velocemente una macchina virtuale linux velocemente e senza problemi, assieme alla fluidità di funzionamento, era un vantaggio incomparabile rispetto alle altre soluzioni. Questo improvviso cambiamento di “stile” metterà sicuramente in difficoltà molti utenti.

SemkinKam,About Parallels:,"I use the program excellent from 2013 to 2018, on one of the MacBooks, but with the next Parallels paid update for the money, I will go to another free BM program.
The version is clearly changing being upgraded under the Mac OS update, etc.
During this time, using the program and systematic paid updates, you can remain without pants.
Tentatively updated to 20,000 rubles. I didn’t count, but, probably, such an amount has already arrived, if not more, plus paid subscriptions. Today I have already bought 5 licenses (FIVE) Licenses, from the version of Parallels Desktop 6 for Mac to Parallels Desktop 10 for Mac. The decision of course to make you!
Now I use another alternative VM program for free on another MacBook, there are small inconveniences, but I'm happy that I don’t have to pay extra for each update of the program.
This is a minus to the Parallels developers that there is no license ...",О программе Parallels:,"Программа отличная пользуюсь с 2013 года по 2018 г., на одном из MacBook, но со следующим платным обновлением Parallels за деньги, буду уходить на другую бесплатную BM программу.
Версия понятно меняется модернизируются под обновление Mac OS и т.д. 
За это время пользования программой и систематическими платными обновлениями можно остаться без штанов. 
Ориентировочно на обновлялся до 20 000 руб. Не подсчитывал, но, наверное, уже такая сумма набежала, если не больше, плюс еще платные подписки. На сегодня купил уже 5 лицензий (ПЯТЬ) Лицензий, с версии Parallels Desktop 6 for Maс по Parallels Desktop 10 for Maс. Решение конечно принимать Вам! 
Сейчас пользуюсь на другом MacBook другой альтернативной программой ВМ бесплатной, есть маленькие неудобства, но меня устраивает, что не надо переплачивать за каждое обновление программы.
Это минус разработчикам Parallels, что нет лицензии пожизненной.

frugrat,avoid buggy,"tried to make a yosemite vm. 3rd try seemed to work but process far too buggy and erratic. will try full program and vm fusion to see if they work better and if my 2014 mbp 13 can handle it.
Retried this app based on an OS X article and it again failed to work for Yosemite.
Tried Parallels 14 and VM Fusion 10. Neither would handle a Yosemite VM but Fusion did pretty well on Windows 10. My personal impression is that despite laudatory Parallels 14 reviews, Fusion is a much better consumer product. It is also priced much better with 1 $80 license covering several macs by the same owner. Parallels requires 1 license per mac. Both products seem optimized for windows and not OS S versions.
Personally I am going to pass on virtualization as difficult, tricky and expensive.",avoid buggy,"tried to make a yosemite vm. 3rd try seemed to work but process far too buggy and erratic. will try full program and vm fusion to see if they work better and if my 2014 mbp 13 can handle it.
