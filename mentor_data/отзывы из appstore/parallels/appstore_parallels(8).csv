Hilacg93,Excellent,"The truth is I love pity that it lasts 14 days nothing more because it is very necessary software for students here in Costa Rica since they only use computers with Win operating system. And I like the application since I have used the virtual machine on my Mac and at the same time the computer has left me very slow or many times it does not work, I like it because it enters at once and it is not so much what they ask for, only the screen is put and you go straight into doing what you need and that is why in my opinion it is something faster and very functional. Better than virtualbox",Excelente,La verdad me encanta lastima que dura 14 dias nada mas pues es software muy necesario para estudiantes aqui en Costa Rica ya que solo usan computadoras con sistema operativo Win.

Airslide,Best VM software I’ve used so far,"First of all, I’m thrilled I can get this through the Mac App Store. I like having updates centralized and knowning that the applications are sandboxed and have to “play nice,” but I never really expected virtualization software to be available here.
Parallels Desktop Lite runs my Linux VMs the fastest of any VM software I’ve used so far. The easy download and install function is great, and the default configurations are performant with relatively easy to understand machine settings. I primarily run it on a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro but my Linux VM even runs fairly well on my 2015 12” MacBook, which surprised me. Definitely recommend giving this one a go, especially if you are aiming to use a Linux distro as a guest OS (I have yet to try Windows, but I imagine it also performs well).",Best VM software I’ve used so far,"First of all, I’m thrilled I can get this through the Mac App Store.

Obi_Vinc,So not practical for me,"The idea - great! Finally Parallels Desktop is also available in the official AppStore.
I thought that we would offer the users who use their Mac in private households the opportunity to use the program for a Windows installation cheaply.
Simply download - create and install Windows partition - done.
… it would be nice
Unfortunately, this lite version only offers you a subscription version of Parallels Desktop (or a free version to use Linux)
A subscription version is an absurdity for a private household that rarely uses Windows - Microsoft has the same problem with the 365 variant.
In my opinion, simply not practical for someone who does not use W10 or Office frequently.
So uninstalled right away.
- I want an inexpensive way to use Parallels (i.e. Windows) on my Mac. For my part, without these functions like ""Drag & Drap"" between Mac & W10.",So für mich nicht praktibel,"Die Idee - super! Endlich wird Parallels Desktop auch im offiziellen AppStore angeboten.

… schön wärs
Leider wird einem in dieser Lite-Version nur eine Abo-Version von Parallels Desktop angeboten (oder eben eine kostenlose Variante um Linux zu verwenden) 
Eine Abo-Version ist für einen privaten Haushalt, der Windows nur in den seltensten Fällen nutzt, ein Unding - das gleiche Problem hat auch Microsoft mit der 365-Variante. 
Meiner Meinung nach einfach nicht praktikabel für jemanden der W10 bzw. Office nicht dauerhauft nutzt.
