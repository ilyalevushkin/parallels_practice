"I chose iPad Pro. After all it was not possible to use it for free.
I rented it because my computer was broken, so I returned it to iPad Pro.
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I used it once a month for the calculation data sent to the company‚Ä¶
Was it 1260 yen once a month?
It's expensive.........
When I see it on my cell phone, it says it's free...
sad‚Ä¶
For such people, neither iPad Pro nor Excel
I didn't need it",1,-1
I‚Äôm so exited about getting Exel because I‚Äôve tried out Microsoft word and I can‚Äôt write.,1,-1
"First of all, we cannot start without the underlying problems. Untrustworthy application start",1,-1
"Great app for the iPad, but it no longer works unless you pay, make it free as before!",1,-1
"There are many doubts about the policy of paying firmly even though there are many bugs.
Especially on the iPad, you can only edit it if you use paid software.",1,-1
"I thought it was suspicious, but it disappeared as soon as I began to trust.
Untrustworthy software that does not know what will happen.",1,-1
I solve many problems üëç,1,-1
The decision to not make Excel available on 10.2 screens is fairly cynical and very disappointing. I kept my household accounts on my old IPad and will now be forced to use an inferior Spreadsheet.,1,-1
"I‚Äôve been using Microsoft Excel and enjoyed the use of VBA programming in my office work. 
And when I installed Microsoft Excel in iPad, all the functions and features are so simple which is very common to Numbers for IOS. It‚Äôs not worth to purchase this app for iPad.",1,-1
"It's so disappointing that I think it is a scam. Moreover, if the price is annual, is it still monthly? ? The star is zero w",1,-1
"Perhaps there i a wat to do this through the app, but I only see the option to sign up for a free trial",1,-1
"How to break: type any number into A2, go to A13 and put in =A2-(A3:A12) and watch cells A13:A22 all populate with what should only be in A13...",1,-1

"Takes ages to boot, often won't boot (iPad Pro 11, 2020). Often has to go through the browser because the app refuses to start.",1,-1
"First of all, I always reminded me that I couldn‚Äôt upload, and all the files couldn‚Äôt be opened until yesterday, which reminded me that I was locked or not authorized.",1,-1
What happened to the last update !!!! I can't access my files !!!,1,-1
grovels for feedback. grovels for feedback. grovels for feedback. grovels for feedback. grovels for feedback.,1,-1
With the free version you can do almost nothing except read the file ...,1,-1
"On my 3rd Gen Ipad Pro 12.9 with IpadOS 13.5.1, app constantly freezes and forces shutdown, makes impossible to work on sheets. Having this problem since last week. Need patch or new update asap.",1,-1
"I personally belong to the group with few usages (from 2 to 5 a month). After the latest update,
All functions are changed to ""subscription"" to use, which for me personally has no use value, so delete the App.
Find other alternative apps!",1,-1
"For whatever reason, to edit and save in the iPad app, you need a subscription. Why not just use the free browser version on OneDrive?",1,-1
"By a landslide, the most impossible app to use. It never works and it‚Äôs impossible to figure out",1,-1
Not sure what happens. Only a reinstallation works but it's not refreshing after closing the app,1,-1
"Although it has reached a level where it can be used without problems, it is a big problem that punctuation marks (.) Become periods (.).
* Do not enter a punctuation mark (.) by itself. With the key of "","" it will be quite a bit for the time being, but please proceed to the fundamental solution quickly. The stress accumulates.",1,-1
"Wow, download it, nothing happens",1,-1
"I suddenly can't sign in...
Worst 3 days to use",1,-1
Awful- every file I open on iPhone and iPad says corrupted- no issue on Mac,1,-1
In is frozen,1,-1

"I wish they had given the option to edit the files. Free only to view, and for that there are a thousand applications including Word and Excel that are also free to view documents. They should clarify it in the description of the App",1,-1
Why while he is free he asks me to pay ????,1,-1
Crashea in Premium version when opening files with complex forms.,1,-1
"Ice-cream, my secret.",1,-1
"Why enter the correct phone number to register an account and still report the wrong format. The password is correct, the message is still wrong forever.",1,-1
F*ck 365 subscription! Will never ever happen!,1,-1
"Android can edit and save without buying Microsoft 365, but Apple can't. Can't you manage that?",1,-1
Log in for that. Feels like MS should snoop on everything. Rather use PC.,1,-1
"If you open this app on iPhone and open a spreadsheet from iCloud, then some time later (say, a couple of days) open the same spreadsheet on iPad, edit it and save it, when you next open the iPhone app it will a) still show the old data it had in memory from two days ago, then b) overwrite the file in the cloud, losing the changes you made on the iPad, by saving the old version from the iPhone. So you end up losing two days of wok. This has happened to me multiple times.
AS AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM this app should check the last edited date of files in the cloud before overwriting newer changes with old versions. It should check for new changes to files when you open the app, instead of displaying stale data. Ideally it would offer the ability to merge the changes on save.",1,-1
difference,1,-1
"I was charged 349 rubles for a subscription, although the application has long been removed !!!
Can I somehow return this money?",1,-1
"I'm using the 4th generation iPad, but it's only on the phone and the pad doesn't go up at 60% even if I try it several times throughout the day. I was trying to use it as a pad..; Why is that?",1,-1
"If not free, then bye",1,-1
"It weighs a lot, does not allow to enter into the account, swears that there is no Internet, without accounting does not allow editing the document",1,-1
Rubbish,1,-1
"Been using this app for a couple of years on my iPhone. Use it for bills etc, useless to me now as I won‚Äôt be paying a monthly subscription. If there were a one time purchase option I would consider. Microsoft is officially redundant in my life now as no longer need any of their products. Good bye Microsoft.",1,-1
Needs more options like desktop program.,1,-1
It does not work,1,-1
"Everything is now very slow. Every now and then it loses my files. Good thing I have a manual backup. 
This is what you get when H1B workers take American jobs.",1,-1
It doesn't work and crashes,1,-1
"Very sorry that you only find out after installing that you cannot edit and save without a Microsoft 365 subscription. With such a subscription you also buy a lot of things that I do not use on my Ipad; like 1T cloud storage. I find it way too expensive for the few times I use excel. If I could buy the app for a one-time, reasonable amount, I would have, but this subscription is too expensive for only Excel use.",1,-1
"This is where we see the unbearable owner side ...
You can have a document on just about any cloud, but of course, not that of Apple. So exit iCloud. You must make a local copy first! Super not practical, unusable even.
You believe in it ? Microsoft did it!",1,-1
Simple features don‚Äôt work like the fill feature and you can‚Äôt open two excel spreadsheets and multitask on the iPads... which I use as my laptop so it‚Äôs pretty much useless.  I can‚Äôt even insert worksheets from one workbook into another. Replace all? Doesn‚Äôt work. Conditional formatting? Nope! It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt even want people to use it. Which is going to drive me to use numbers before it drives me to use windows device. I‚Äôm an accountant and I use my iPad for everything.,1,-1
Been broken since the update 2.38 - email after email after email sent without a response FIX IT!!,1,-1
"There is any slag as a source, and there is no Yandex drive in 2020.
This is the bottom.",1,-1
This app regularly doesn‚Äôt save automatically especially if you‚Äôve got a cell highlighted after doing a copy and paste. Didn‚Äôt save a whole ton of work and now I have to do it all over again!!!!!,1,-1
I can't sign in,1,-1
"I can't use it, it gives some kind of constant error",1,-1
"Statistics for more than a week, when I was about to summarize, told me that I am sorry, the problem can not be opened, what garbage software? There is no sign? Sorry for what use?",1,-1
"Even if I enter the address, I can not log in, the page when it can not be stopped does not work, and when I try to register newly, this email address is used.
It is said that.
Help page is useless.
There is no link to go further.
Are you motivated?",1,-1
"This last 2 days, i cant open my file from dropbox.. 
 i dont use microsoft cloud because its hard to open on my notebook",1,-1
Purchased and cannot be used. Deduct money every month,1,-1
üòï Nothing will be used after opening,1,-1
"Every time he changes to another application and comes back, he closes the file and has to open it again. Disappointing!",1,-1
The reason we all open apps is for us to use the app. We do not open them to constantly rate them any give reviews.,1,-1
"It requires membership, ie money to make arrangements. It's ridiculous",1,-1
Can not disable setting where Excel asks to read my content without a pop up each time the app starts. Very annoying and poor UI.,1,-1
I would give it a 5-star if it had the much-needed goalseeking function. Can anyone tell me why this is missing from the version available on IPad? Would be much appreciated.,1,-1
Warning * might cause depression *,1,-1
Nothing close to Excel for PCs.,1,-1
"Working in iOs environment I find excel very laborious
also to work a file I have to turn it into numbers work it and convert it again otherwise I should buy the windows package on my mac only for the files that are sent to me in excel
if it receives an excel file it converts it without purchasing the package",1,-1
Laughed,1,-1
"I'm an iPad Pro user
11 inches paid;;;
The monthly payment amount is too big!
Please adjust!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,-1
"I've been using Excel for a long time, so I bought Office for Mac and used it for many years.
After updating the Mac OS, I could not use it unless I paid for Office 365, so I stopped using Excel in the future and decided to use a spreadsheet. I'm sorry.",1,-1
Excel cannot be opened,1,-1
"Here we are again, and here I‚Äôm saying the same thing with these as usual. I know how hard it is to build these things, but this is just awful. Why are the Office apps so neutered on iPad OS? This platform has so much potential, but apps like this just ruin it. Is this done on purpose? I love Windows 10 and how Office is implemented there, why can we not have the same experience here?
There is no reason.
My 15 year old IBM ThinkPad X41 running Windows 10 1709 with Excel and all the other Office apps flawlessly‚Ä¶ beautifully compared to what ever MS is putting out here on iPadOS. It‚Äôs really just such a shame. Kind of makes me just want to switch to a Windows based 2 in 1‚Ä¶ is that the plan Microsoft?
Where are more than half of the features that are available on the desktop? Don‚Äôt you have some unified code base? That‚Äôs the only reason I can image these versions being so vastly separate. Make it one!!!
Please fix this, you‚Äôre doing such a great job on your own platforms, but here‚Ä¶ having no Office apps would be better than this.",1,-1
"I have 30+ years experience using the desktop version of MS Excel on Windows based PCs. Consider myself fairly proficient. iOS version on iPad looks like, but does not function like, Windows desktop version. First, it appears to be web based so there is serious lag time between attempting to make changes and seeing your attempt appear on-screen. Second, I have spent last ten minutes attempting to copy three adjacent cells (two with numbers and third with formula adding them together) then pasting them into several rows directly below them. Highlight the three cells, long press then tap Copy, highlight group of cells below, long press then tap Paste and what happens? Those three Copied cells are not Pasted but instead one cell shows contents of last item (a cell description) I Copied from a website. Tried four times, same result. Very frustrating. Shame on me for expecting a Microsoft app to work well on an Apple operating system. Guess I need to learn how to use Numbers.",1,-1
I needed real Excel.  This version is very emasculated and not useful for serious work.,1,-1
Double tapping on a cell or long tap and choosing edit DOES NOT bring up the on screen keyboard. Being able to enter data is kind of important. I have screwed around with this for 20 minutes and google and YouTubed to no relief. Uninstalling......,1,-1
you are greedy,1,-1
"Why are so many functions missing in Excel for iPad? For example, there is no conditional formatting. I use this function very often. In the meantime, iPads are more powerful than inexpensive laptops with Windows, which runs the desktop version of MS Excel. Accordingly, the iPad MUST have a full Excel, which offers ALL functions of the desktop version. Or also: The desktop version must be FULLY offered for iPadOS. The same also applies to Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, Skype and all other Microsoft programs.",1,-1
Garbage Microsoft downgrades as usual,1,-1
"Isn't it too dokh .. I go for money, aliens?
And so you are already robbing the whole world, but you also want to read all my documents stored on your server and so that I also pay you for earcaps every month for this?
Well, you are insolent, filthy faces!",1,-1
I paid almost $100.00 for it.   Now all my data is gone and they want $7.99 a month.,1,-1
This apps TRASH,1,-1
"I originally wanted to use it temporarily, it was particularly inconvenient, it was useless, and I forgot to close the subscription. As a result, I was charged an annual fee of 298, which was very inhumane.",1,-1
Nothing more frustrating than the auto save doesn‚Äôt work and neither does the save when closing the application you‚Äôre working on. So basically if you spend a few hours on a spreadsheet and close it thinking it‚Äôs now saved. It‚Äôs not. Fix this or I‚Äôll forever leave and finally just go to numbers. Fed up with untested bs from Microsoft!,1,-1

"Excel is amazing.  Take a few of the free, and pay, tutorials posted all over for Excel.  I have always worked with the product so I am very familiar with it, but I took it out for a long distance run and really enhanced my knowledge of just what it can do and I was truly amazed, and very pleased with the outcome.  Wow, it is so much more than even I, who thought of myself as an expert with the application, knew it to be.  Very impressive.  Very impressive indeed. Thanks to all those seemingly little tutorials that most people just pass over, but when used, turn out to be quit something.  And thank you to all of you who put them together for us.  That alone was not a simple task.  
Give it a try!  You are at home on self isolation, use this time to do what I did and stretch this application beyond what you imagined.  I can‚Äôt stop writing code or modeling all kinds of things now.  It has been quite good indeed.  A new adventure, with learning, instead of mind numbing nothingness in this nasty pandemic environment.  Yeah, go for it, wow.  Really fun and remarkable new stuff to dabble with.",5,1

"Hello everyone who uses Excel,
So I was asked to rate to put Excel and I really like this program.
But the slim version that is in Office 365 and is adapted for iPad, it is really lousy. Really useless as excel. It is an attempt to integrate a lot of fragments from several more Office products.
It would have been much better to try to keep the body of excel so you recognized yourself. Of course, I understand that you have to reduce the scope of the program's original size, but not in this way.
