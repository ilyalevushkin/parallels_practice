"There was a two-week trial version
I made a payment when I clicked the wrong way.
I thought it was just a card registration.
I'm embarrassed
Please refund."

"The charges are too expensive, and they are charged every year. If you want money or crazy, you can search virtualbox for free. I have been using this for so many years. I don’t know where this software and VB are strong? But at this price, I think it's good to use free"

Does not have OpenGL support in the NVIDIA Geforce GT 750M drivers for Linux. So unfortunatly the whole purpose of using Linux to avoid Mac depriciating OpenGL/OpenCL for 3D rendering is undermined by the lack of support in the driver too. From what I have read this is true for Windows graphics card drivers in Parallels as well.

"I bought a Macbook pro 2020 because the Macbook pro 2012 Mid I had been using for a long time broke, but I could not downgrade from Catalina to Mojave, and most of the software I purchased could not be specified, so I managed to use it as a virtual environment for Catalina. I tried to use Mojave there and tried to operate the software, but there is no old mac OS such as Mojave among the programs that can be used for free, there is a Windows OS that requires an additional charge It was only free Linux.
I installed it to run Mojave or Sierra with Catalina, but I couldn't even download the old mac OS, so it didn't help at all."

"I understand that companies would rather get paid for doning nothing in the form of software subscriptions, but this is unacceptable. There should be an option for a one time purchase for software. As long as the software is subscriotion based, it would be beter to subscribe to something like AWS or Microsoft Azure instead."

"The software is good, just to pay. The reason why I buy a Mac is because I hate Microsoft Windows. I have to pay, but in order to download a software, the format is exe, I can only use Windows. I downloaded this one and it didn't work. I found the same company's software and almost replaced my original system. 😤"

"The app store version of Parallels suffers from a major memory leak and completely ignores the RAM limitations specified in the configuration. Eg. If you select 8GB it will show 8GB in Windows, however, if you check the Parallels process in Activity Monitor on MacOS the app will work its way up to using 16GB of your 16GB memory bringing your system to a crawl. The App Store version should be avoided. Switching to the desktop version fixed this issue immediately. No changes made to host or configuration settings and the VM is now respecting the memory limitations put in place."

"To work from home, I needed an environment exactly the same as my PC at work (Windows 8.1, many old apps). For this reason, I purchased a one-year license for Parallels DEsktop, which has expired 30 days, at the Apple store.
However, even though I had already purchased it in my iTunes Store account, my account in Parallels was still expired. When I try to contact support, I cannot contact because my email address and telephone number are not available. I searched for information on the website and tried various things, but nothing happened.
I could buy more licenses from Parallels site and build the environment I wanted. This may cause problems, but it's working for now.
So, I think the software itself is very good. On the other hand, the support in Japanese is as good as it is, and it erases the splendor of the software. What makes me angry above all else is that licenses purchased from the Apple Store remain expired in Parallels My Account, forever. It's an unnecessary license at the moment, but every time I see it, I get angry.
Therefore, the rating is zero. Actually ..."

"Trial expired in the App Store and paid 96,000 won..
When running the app, why is the expired trial only registered in the subscription information, and why is the new purchase (subscription) not activated?
It is frustrating."

"Parallels has chosen to handicap this product, slow-roll updates with fixes, and deliberatly make it nearly unusable to drive business outside the app store. This developer should be banned from distribution in the app store."

"Running OSX Catalina 10.50.4 but, wanted to continue the games which only ran with 32bit libs.  So, decided to deploy a Virtual Machine dedicated to Recreation :).   Installed the latest VMware Fusion Pro, and there were so many .NET and performance errors, tbat it was a non-starter (literally).  So, recalled that I had a Legacy Parallels License, and decided to upgrade.  Well, to be breif and honest I was simply AMAZED at how Parallels ran any/all Windows games with absoltely no issues.   I even set up the Parallels Windows 10 VM with 1/2 the Memory, and ran circles around VMware Fusion.   Excellent Job Parallels, I am IN!!!!"

"I first downloaded parallels because i needed to use windows for work, but almost every month i had issues with it. I had to reinstall parallels 3 times loosing everytime the information.

"I downloaded the program in the app store, after 14 days the trial period ended and 3990 was automatically written off. I did not receive a license key. The application does not start, there is no key, for several days without a result I’ve been running in a circle in an attempt to get either an activation key or money back. In general, the product is normal, consciously willing to spend this money. But now I don’t know, it’s a little expensive with this approach."

"The WiFi does not work and the wired network does not work properly either, so you cannot access your own data on the NAS drive or network printer. Network programs are therefore not running, which is why I actually bought Parallels. The support only shows options that are not available to me. The number in Munich is just an incomprehensible English language speech computer
I tried very hard to solve the problem via Facebook support - it took me many hours to get the information in almost incomprehensible English that network use is not intended in this edition! Absolutely inferior !!!
For the installation it was written that the boot camp installation can be taken over. Of course that was not possible! Windows activation was only possible using a support call lasting several hours.
Money thrown out for me! The subscription model is a cheek !! And the whole sh ... for just under € 80 a year !!!
Just stay away !!!!!!"

"Works fine in general and I prefer it to the other version that is not sandboxed and requires kernel extensions.
This version is  treated as a second tier product by the developer who would rather sell directly on their own site. The app is rarely updated, so don't expect bugfixes or feature updates.
The support is just okay... Parallels is not committed to making this product the best it can be because it competes with their other, higher-priced products.
I reported a bug due to a conflict with another major product to Parallels that was acknowledged and put on the fix list for some time in likely never since this product is only updated about once per year."

"It turned out to be a very unreliable program ((, lost the info (six months of work). After installation, it began to fail, then hang. Then it did not start at all due to some kind of disk access error. Backups, rollbacks to previous versions did not help. I looked for a solution to the problem I didn’t find it on the network, but I didn’t find it. As a result, I had to delete it, it also went off without problems, access to 250 GB of the disk is blocked (the disk utility does not help). In general, there is only one ... I definitely won’t recommend it."

"I've subscribed for the trial, but the software doesn't open, it just gives me an option to subscribe or register an existing subscription. If I subscribe again I just end up at the same place.

"I was using a different virtual drive, but I tried it on a 14-day trial and it's faster and more comfortable. However, instead of using Windows frequently, I tried to quit the free trial within the evaluation period, but it was difficult to find a way. Answering many similar questions didn't help either. Share how you found it.
App store -> Click your ID at the bottom left -> View information in the top row -> Click'Manage' on the right side of'Subscription' at the bottom of the third'Management' tab from the top -> Find the app you want to unsubscribe and'Subscribe cancel'
You can do it in order. For reference, if you are using the same App Store ID, you can also unsubscribe from your iPhone or iPad.
I hope it was helpful for those who were embarrassed because I couldn't cancel my free trial like me."

The previous version told me to buy a new one because of the result of the upgrade of the operating system. It feels like you can only pay for half of your hair. Then I saw that the customer service responded in simplified Chinese. Suddenly the scalp felt numb. The computer's most basic system had to override the mainland's software. It was extremely uneasy.

"I'm sorry, but how is this worth $80 dollars a year? All I want to do is use certain applications Mac can't and Windows can, yet I shouldn't need to spend that much to do so.

I think that if management had revised prices, it would have attracted much more users! The rest is a very worthy program!"

"Been paying these people for 3 years and finally had enough and moving to VMware Fusion, which is much better.  Straw that broke my back was Parallels insistence on showing me ads for their other products every week. I tried opting-out, tried opening support cases, these people just don't care.
If you're trying to play a game this *MIGHT* work for you.  If you need to run VM's or do anything business-related or ""mission-critical"" stay far away."

"This is a significant downgrade from previous versions. Some olders guest OS versions simply won't run. Zero performance improvement over previous versions. Requires subscription to run.

My favorite part about the two week trial is that you can download and upload what ever windows application you want, and it ACTUALLY works! I can flip between my mac and windows 10 program on the same computer or have them open at the same exact time. Smooth simple download! I already told my uncle to download it. I love Parallels!"

"I already have Parallels Desktop for Mac running in an older version. I then read about this lite version.
Since I'm only dealing with a macOS VM, I find this interesting. Only 4 Mac programs are required, which are not supported in the current version 10.15. So I downloaded the app and wanted to test it. When I open it for the first time, however, I am asked directly to complete the annual subscription. I cannot use any function before.
And it should only cost something for the Windows version (to my knowledge) and otherwise be free of charge. I'm only interested in macOS virtualization.
@Paralles support:
The concept is so daunting. It's a shame. Even if the mac OS virtualization should also cost, I would like to be able to test it at least for now.
I look forward to your feedback and solutions. Thank you."

"Assuming that I will receive a full version after completing the subscription, I unfortunately had to make it clear that this version cannot be compared to the functionality of Parallels Desktop.

"Completely unsatisfied. 
Bought the product with only one need: connecting an external HD to my Mac.
Spent hours reading all the support pages when it didn't work. Tried everything and it still didn't work.
Reached out to Parallel's customer support asking for a call, that portal doesn't work.
Emailed customer service saying I would like to speak to a person and not get an email of support pages, then I got an email after business hours with the support pages I asked not to get, and then the case was closed because it was a weekend.
Reached out again via chat this time and the agent wanted remote access. I had to convince him he needed to call me first. Begrudgingly he did. 
Spent 3 hours of wasted time as he experimented and found it still wasn't working.
He elevated the case. 
Received and email at the issue was not resolved. When I inquired further I was told I should wait for the next build.
I asked for a refund or at least that the subscription start from when Parallels worked out their program and I was just directed to Apple support.
Not one time along the way in writing or verbally did anyone apologize that your product was simply not working and was costing me precious time and money. 
If a toaster doesn't make toast, then why call it a toaster. If a virtual machine doesn't allow external HDs to work, they why do Mac users need it?"

"I'm thankful to God for parallels. I upgraded to catalina, unaware of the discontinuation of 32-bit support  (my fault) . Naturally some programs that did not come 64-bit stopped. I installed parallel with windows 10 and the rest is history."

"Parallels Desktop Lite is very intuitive to use expecially if you are use to the ""APPLE"" format.  I have been a faithful Apple Mac user for 11 years.  I purchased my new ""Mac Book Pro October, 2019.  
I can't wait to use the full Parallels on my new Mac Book Pro as well as the full version of Windows for my Mac Book Pro..
I purchased this teacher product back in 2017 for my long-term substitute assignment.  Because of the outdated feature of my 2008 Mac Book Pro, I was not able to use this product until I purchased and installed by Parallels Desktop Lite.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!"

"The Parallels website description says that Lite version can be used to set up VMs of Linux for free; when starting the application we get a paywall that requires a subscription even though it mentions a 14 days trial (but even that, I could not see how to activate). Communication on price should be more honest."
;
1
;

"After installation, it is the subscription screen. There is no 14-day trial and free use of Linux. The cost is also the same as the full version, so if I really want to buy it, just buy the full version, and it will be discounted every year.
I don't see what's the point of this"
;
1
;

"Works seamlessly. But if all you need to do is run an old version of OSX in order to run a single, simple older app (Circus Ponies Notebook for lab), then paying $80/year is extortion. I switched to VirtualBox, which took a couple weeks to troubleshoot, but it's free. I would pay $10/year for a stripped down, underpowered Parallels version, if they ever made that."

"I used to be a Parallels user in the past, before they switched to a subscription model with multiple tiers.  The standard non-pro version is now $99 for a perpetual license and removes many of the features that I depended on. Instead, in order to get full functionality, you need to bump up to the 'Pro' version.  Folks, do yourself a favor, and skip this.  Just grab VirtualBox for free, and you will not have to deal with an expensive gimped virtualization software.
If Parallels had the same pricing model like they did in the past, then I wouldn't mind paying $99 for a full featured virtualization software.  At this point in time, however, I cannot recommend it at all..."

"I'm only interested in running Linux occasionally in a guest on my Mac and it seems to be significantly faster than VirtualBox (at least when it comes to handling the retina display). Taking a star off as the lastest update requires a yearly subscription, although I've been given 1 year trial as an existing user (thanks!). I have a year to think about, try other options, but it looks like buying Parallels Desktop directly (one-off payment, possibly with the occasional upgrade) is still cheaper than the Parallels Desktop *Lite* subscription (from which Apple probably grabs a bing chunk).
EDIT: I don't really get the pricing. There is a £73.99 yearly subscription for the ""lite"" version when you can get the full desktop version (with a few additional features like bridged network) for £69.99 with a significant discount for subsequent upgrades. I guess the higher price here is just for App Store share. When the free year ends, I'll go for the proper Parallels Desktop and uninstall the lite one."

"On the official site, it seems that the version is newer and supported - I couldn’t start the version from the App Store in the demo mode, just to launch the ubuntu virtual machine.
When launched, the application requested information about the bank card, so that after two weeks to remove 5k ... In general, some kind of gray scheme.
In addition: I did not find the option to use a monthly subscription."

"I could not get the internet to work, tried everything I found concerning this topic"

"The good thing about Parallels Lite was that it could be used to run Linux VMs without an additional license. This is no longer possible, Lite wants a subscription at full price. Too bad - I would very much like to use Parallels on the large Mac, but on the small I would have liked to continue using it for occasional use for Linux-only virtualization. Now I have to use VirtualBox ..."
;
1

"This app should not be on App Store in my honest opinion. They give you a trial that they don’t say is a trial and then after you have downloaded it, come off with “o by the way”…The make it hard to remove it when you see that they are going to charge you a yearly fee. Personally, I don’t want something that is going to charge a hefty fee per year just to use it. I do NOT want to subscribe to this. I don’t want it, period."

"I have used Parallels in the past, and have been able to run Linux VMs for free. I don’t need to run Windows VMs, so I didn’t buy the Windows addon.
It has been a while and I am now trying to use it again, only to find that it requires a yearly subscription. Once the 14-day trial is expired, I cannot use my existing Linux VMs anymore! That is just ridiculous."

"Apparently everything on the web talking about how Parallels Lite is free for non-Windows Guest OSes is out-of-date. I can't get past the launch window that forces me to agree to a $80 yearly subscription after the 14-day trial. I liked Parallels when I used it in the past, and even bought a license a time or two, but moving everything behind a subscription is a no-go for me. App deleted."

In the name of the App there is written Lite which assumes it is a basic version to be used safely with the right limits as is done with the Lite versions of the software.

This version is  treated as a second tier product by the developer who would rather sell directly on their own site. The update frequency very low and the feature set is intentionally limited.
The support is just okay... Parallels is not committed to making this product the best it can be because they see it as a conflict with their other product lines.
I reported a bug due to a conflict with another major product to Parallels that was acknowledged and put on the fix list for some time in likely never since this product is only updated once per year."

"Why did I not get a messeage before the trial version became a one year subscription?
Now I am stuck with a product I dont use and dont have installed. I only wanted to try Paralles and it did not fit my purpose. Just because you try something does not mean you want to buy it, or....???
And a somehow cant get a refound."

"After reinstalling on my iMac, I found that I now have to subscribe. So far, you only had to pay the purchase price for the Lite version if you wanted to use the software as the basis for a Windows installation. The program could be used free of charge as a virtual machine with macOS or Linux. That's enough of that. After installing the current version 1.4.0, the app inevitably prompts for registration or payment. The only option is a free test for 14 days."

"A little bit of bait-and-switch. When it was released (and I first downloaded it), this app was free of charge to create a macOS virtual machine. It only cost money to install Windows. 
Lots of five star reviews!
Since then Parallels has changed this so that it now requires a £70  yearly subscription to do ANYTHING with this app. Ah, but they've already got the good reviews, right? 
I intend to setup a free coffee shop outside Parallels' headquarters. I'm sure people will gleefully order cappuccinos! However, when anybody actually comes to the counter to pick-up their order I will tell them that, unfortunately, their coffee now costs money."

"Software stopped working at the end of the trial period. It took me 6 days of back and forth on the support to get the problem fixed at their end.

Latest update rendered software unusable UNLESS you signup for an account and PAY a subscription fee WITH ABSOULTELY NO WARNING.  No where in the release notes was this stated.  Unacceptable.  Uninstalled.  Moved to a different product.

"I purchased parallels 8 back in the day to run Windows on my mac. Being a student I had to bite the bullet for such a cost but I did it anyway. A few months went by and they came up with paralles 9 and I realized that to continue to get the later features I would have to buy a parallels 9. That's one of the worst business models. 
That being said, they somewhat made up for it by allowing users to run Linux for free using the Lite version. Well none of that anymore as well. I find it very strange that a company making a generally good product has such a bad business model"

"It was great during the 14 day trial.  I paid for the subscription but now it will not open for me.  It keeps trying to make me pay for another suscription plan.  I opened a ticket and the only response I got was to restart or uninstall and reinstall.  I’ve done all of those things, so then I clicked on the link that was sent to me to use if nothing else worked and that link was an error code (link not found). Why is there not a contact us link on your page and why can’t I open a chat?  I will have open a complaint if I can’t get on within the next couple of days.  I don’t believe in paying for nothing.  
UPDATE:  This review did get a response for a little bit.  I opened the tech report and sent the two screenshots they asked for and have heard nothing since.  It’s been two weeks.  I don’t need the aggravation, I just want my money back since I have no more access.  Who do I contact for that?"

"The subscription policy is, in itself, absolutely legitimate. It is not at all correct to attract users by offering some free functions (such as support for Linux or macOS) and suddenly - when the user now relies on the product - block everything and make it paid (salty).
For occasional or limited use, obviously Parallels (remove the ""Lite"" at this point) is not adequate - even considering that VirtualBox is free.
Waiting for useless standard reply with subscription info as happened to everyone else.
P. S. - I have previously purchased licenses every holy year for at least seven years, so I have already given him more than 500 euros. Now also enough."

They pulled a classic bait and switch scam here. Lure in new users with free functionality. Get a large base of users with highly positive reviews to boost the ranking of the app on the Store. Then BAM! Change the terms and start charging an arm and a leg. No scruples with this company.
Oh, and a note to the developer, please don't respond with your canned responses. We've read them already. We know what you did. It's insulting."

"Turns out, after grumbling so badly… It does work with the latest version of Windows; on stability I can’t comment as I haven’t used it enough yet. 
So, I owe these guys an apology and one star goes to five… 
The problem was VMWARE… I have Fusion 8.5.8 on High Sierra and (unbeknownst to me) it had just blew out the VM I was trying to convert. Fortunately, it wasn’t anything important. So I unzipped the saved copy and tried again. Worked a treat, not much of an advert for Fusion… The only thing this doesn’t do (which is important to me) is passing the VT-x instruction set through to the VM. I suppose they’d consider that a business requirement… But I want a product that uses the Apple Hypervior Framework; and a complete removal of unstable kexts….
Update (2017-12-08)
I’m finding the binding to the network adapter a bit hit and miss (using a macOS VM). This results in me having to reboot the VM if networking doesn’t initialise on first boot. Fortunately a second boot has always worked (to date)…
Update (2018-09-03)
I note the increase in subscription costs. Uncompetitive. VMWare Fusion is half price that for an ongoing upgrade. The stars are down again...
Update (2019-03-16)
apparently subscription procies won't be remaining the same as they were once 'free'. Thank the lord for time machine backups!"

"Disappointed with trial experience with v1.4.0, running macOS Mojave on both host and guest VM.  In VM:
1. trackpad not properly detected (instead it is detected as a mouse), so cannot perform normal trackpad gestures, such as zooming, page fwd/back paging, smart zoom, force-click, etc.
2. scrolling with trackpad works, but is very fast and jumpy, (even with mouse scroll speed set to min.), and does not support inertia.  This makes using most apps, including Safari, very difficult.
3. Touch Bar not detected:
    * Can’t use keyboard/shortcuts settings to configure app to show full set of function keys
    * By default, F10 adjusts mute/unmute, must go into settings to configure to treat as function keys
4. It seems GPU acceleration is not supported, so you end up with corrupt safari tab titles, and apps may malfunction (such as those built on Electron) unless you can run them in a mode that disables trying to use GPU.  Parallels says this is a limitation of macOS.
5. The App Store license for Parallels Lite currently (2019-12-13) says you can install the sw to run VMs other than Windows, but Windows VMs require paid subscription.  However, it seems in reality you cannot run ANY VMs without a paid subscription. 
It seems that a product for Mac would better support Mac features on a Mac VM, but it seems that Windows support might be better for some of these features.  Also, when I tried to get these issues addressed several times with support, they would quickly respond, but we never seemed to solve any of the problems - they would just keep asking me to re-install the tools, generate a technical report, etc.  At one point, they even told me Parallels Lite doesn’t support Mojave (which I don’t think is true, as the the 1.4.0 release notes in the App Store say “Ready for macOS 10.14 Mojave”.
While it doesn’t seem that Parallels crashes the macOS host like some competitor’s products do, and it is great that Parallels provides an app-store (and therefore sandboxed) product, there are still some serious problems with this version (1.4.0)."

"Parallels up to their old tricks as usual. Linux support was free (since most people really need windows), but an auto-update pulls the rug out from under the user. This is exactly like how they run their full desktop product. You are required to pump cash into the program for it to just function with zero improvements. It's a protection racket when you pay again for the same (or less) functionality just because Apple releases a new version of MacOS. Use anything other than parallels. Literally, anything else."

I need a virtualization program to run and test a Linux. Parallels was warmly recommended to me. I wanted to test it. This did not happen because I first have to subscribe. What shoud that?

"As of version 1.4, it forces you to subscribe to their € 79 a year plan, being the first year free.
When you have to subscribe even if the first year is free you have to register with an account by force. Before you could use the app without having to make an account and run your Linux and macOS machines without paying anything.
And the worst. Although I have accepted the change at the moment and have subscribed, the app only shows ""Processing Subscription ..."" and does not let me do anything.
Very bad. For this disaster it is better to use VirtualBox than if it is free."

More and more companies are getting greedy and want money for what should be a one time purchase."

WTH. You already have parallels desktop that’s $80/year, why are you crippling lite?? Make a linux only version that cannot run windows, put it up for $10 and maybe that would be ok, but this situation is rediculous.

"you are quietly working with the parallels lite until one day it is updated and they tell you that you either pay or you are looking for something else. I don't know if re-installing the previous version can continue updating. Good luck, I don't think of going through your hoop when you do things treacherously. I think you should be able to continue using the version you had installed legally. if it is not legally it will be not legally. i am against piracy but i will ok add an exception"

"After a year of use, the application has changed from free to subscription model, after UPDATE! In addition, I was forced to agree to collect information about me, because even a free trial requires the creation of an account (I have to somehow transfer my data from virtual machines). The situation is unacceptable and the program is not worth any money if we have docker / oracle virtual box / qemu. Of course, they don't work as well on a Mac as parallels worked, apple is once again paying for tools that are free on other systems to use free linux or windows that you have already bought. NEVER MORE APPLE PRODUCTS!"

"For a one-off fee of 79 euros, I would perhaps buy the app. With a subscription price of 15 €, I would maybe go with it. But 79 € a year, no thanks. Then I install Ubuntu on my Mac in an alternative way. Farewell!"

"All of a sudden, I can no longer access my VMs without signing up for their 1-year trial and authorizing an auto-renewal. Parallels Desktop Lite recently started requiring a subscription to use it for features that were previously free (in my case, running a Linux VM)."
;
1
;

"Suddenly, with no warning, this previousy free-to-use software demanded me to create an account and required an annual subscription before I could access my business records in tax season! I followed the process required, hoping I can find an alternate before having to shell out the ransom money, BUT... the system immediately attempted to install Parallels Light Tools Update, and froze at 62% mark and no restarts or suspends or the like can get it running again.  I am currently restoring the whole pvm file from my backups in hopes that I can get it working again and recover my critical data."

"With the latest version of the app, I have to subscribe, although I only wanted to set up a MacOS test system. It may be that the first year is free (which I only find out indirectly when I read the reviews here - Dear Parallels Support Your last support document (Article ID: 123797) is from October 2016 !!!) , nevertheless I want to test a software first and then decide. This creates the impression that the aim is to make customers forgetful enough to cancel in good time. And who wants to sell here, Parallels or me? Shouldn't a manufacturer first reveal the advantages of the product and accommodate the customer? I'm sorry, I reject this (new) product policy for Parallels Desktop lite. Therefore no subscription and only one star. I will now use either VM Fusionware (which I can test before I buy) or VirtualBox."

Today I opened it up only to find a screen saying i needed to pay to use a ubuntu vm. Parallels doesnt even have support for the current version. It is 2 major versions behind on ubuntu. So all of a sudden and with no warning im required to pay for out of date software. Thats a no thanks from me.

"I installed Ubuntu 16.04.5 by myself. I haven't done heavy processing yet, but the operation is light as much as I touch the GUI.
Regarding the billing plan display, I was worried that it is difficult to know if I am currently billing. Currently it is a trial period, so it's free, but it's a shame that after the trial, it became a pay even for using Linux only (it is the same price as Windows)."

"Version 1.3.3 used to be Free for running MacOS and Linux VMs. However, IN AN UPDATE, Parallels have changed the priced model, and now require a large subscription fee to use this product at all.
I'd be happy to pay a small purchase fee to keep using this, but £74 per year? Outrageous.
What's worse is that it's not even the cheapest price for the non-Lite Parallels version on their website."

"The freemium model was much more interesting .. now a subscription is required to use version 1.4 .. and of course, no information on this in the details of this update published in the Store .. so from the update since 1.3.3 we lose everything and the subscription becomes mandatory."
;
1
;

"The free version used to support Linux. Parallels has opted to change this to a subscription based feature in an update. I would be okay with this if the new version was a separate app (i.e. existing users could keep using the old version, without any new features). Instead, auto-update kicked in, I find myself in front of a screen demanding a login (not previously required) when I'm trying to get unversity work done on a time crunch, and I find out that the software wants to charge me going forward after a trial period. Again, my biggest issue with this is the update to an existing app--most other apps that have gone to a subscription model have a separate app store listing for their new version to avoid this problem, or permanently grandfather in old users to certain feature sets. If parallels communicated this change at some point, they did not do so in the app any time I've been using it the last few months, and I must say I'm very disappointed."

"Latest update to 1.4 changes the free version to a $80/year subscription with NO WARNING.  You won’t be able to access your previously free VMs without making an account and signing up for a subscription.  If this is unacceptable to you, be sure to move your VMs prior to updating."

"I can't believe they'd pull a stunt like this.  My app auto-updated and now I have to create a subscribtion to continue using it.

"Used to be free to run Linux based OS’s, now Parallels got desperate and needs cash, so charging for the “lite” model is a no brainer: don’t use it, instead check out Oracle’s free, stable and easy to use VirtualBox.  My download of Parallels Lite was corrupted twice in a row, won’t be a third time.  Complete garbage.  Parallels has gone downhill…sad when a business resorts to desperate charges to survive.  Focus on quality and reliability first…then worry about getting paid.  I’ve been a user of Parallels for years, I’ve seen the decline in quality and customer service…junk.  Furthermore, to advertise this on the App store as Price: Free is false advertising…a “trial” period is not the same as “free” - stop being so deceptive."

"The best virtualization solution I have ever used. I have not seen anything more convenient on any of the platforms (and previously used both Windows and Linux distributions). The only negative is the price. 6000 rub. for an annual subscription is really expensive. With a price at least half the price, it would be an ideal solution for home use."
;
1
;

"With the update to version 1.4.0, the application's use policy appears to have changed radically: now it seems mandatory to subscribe to a subscription, even if with a free trial period. The negative opinion is linked to this radical change that is not adequately highlighted.
I believe that version 1.3.0 was an excellent application for those who, like me, need to use a linux virtual machine and do not intend to install windows. The ability to quickly create a linux virtual machine quickly and without problems, together with the fluidity of operation, was an incomparable advantage compared to other solutions. This sudden change of ""style"" will certainly put many users in difficulty.
I hope some clarification will come from the developer."

I had the previous version (1.3.3) and yesterday I updated to 1.4.0: did it become paid? I can no longer start any virtual machine except by subscribing to an annual subscription for € 79.99?!?!?! (I have various MacOS machines for testing and no Windows machines). I had to restore 1.3.3 from Time Machine.
;
1
;

"Oops, updating tells me that I have to buy a subscription, although they give me 1 year free (... if it would not seem like a robbery), to continue using my Linux virtual machine, but then I would have to pay € 80 / year ... It seems excessive to me.
In short, we will have to find another way to continue using Linux. At the end of the day it is free software!"

1

"Everything was perfect, used only for Linux and when upgrading to 1.4.0 I started asking to buy for 6000. I have to leave for VBox"

"And the point of the Lite version is now, what?
I dont need to use this software often, but when i do (running Linux) it does what I need very well. But now the ability to run Linux for free has been removed. Due to already using the software I have been granted a years subsciption for free (as long as I sign up to have an account). I will not be paying the subscriptin fee, ever. Time to look elsewhere, goodbye ""Lite"""

"through an update they have also paid for the license for those who use Linux virtual machines, be ashamed!"

"With version 1.4.0 Parallels has a purchase obligation and therefore even Linux is no longer available for free. In principle, I have no problem taking 10-15 euros a year to virtualize my Linux, but 79 euros per year is too steep for me.
It is well known that Parallels has been charging immensely high prices for hardly any equivalent for years. So unfortunately it will be Virtualbox again or a one-time payment for VMWare Fusion.
I am aware that the first year is for free with the subscription, but I do not allow myself to be maneuvered into the obligation to buy."
;

"After the update, even for Linux, a paid subscription is needed, how is it then different from Paralles Desktop? The application has lost its meaning."
;

Unfortunately I am not even allowed to run Linux anymore. Every time I start the app I am forced to log in. After the login you have to pay. There is also no button to cancel.

"After I updated it, it should be free, but now I am required to purchase it at startup. The situation is the same even if you uninstall and then reinstall. I was in trouble...
If it is corrected, it is comfortable to use, so use it."
;
1
;

The application has just been updated and opening it forces me to purchase a subscription. It does not leave the option to continue with the free version when you use Linux.
;
1

"With the 1.4 update, you are forced to sign in with a Parallels account, then scribe to a yearly plan. Seems this cannot be by-pass to even run Linux/macOS like previous versions for free"
;
1
;

"1.4.0 requires subscription for all OSes now.
Parallels is perfectly within its rights to decide how to charge for the product; but to release an update with such a change without mentioning it in the release notes AT ALL is user-hostile and so likely to be in bad faith, that the quality of the product is not really a decisive factor when deciding whether to buy the now-required subscription any more."
;
1
;

"You can use it for free for Linux and Unix (macOS) ... A luxury! If you need to use Windows you have to pay. Personally, having used its paid version, I recommend it 100%!
For me the main advantage (apart from its freeness) is the fact of working without any installer, without extensions (kext) that can cause problems and under the extra security provided by the sandbox. Good job Parallels team!"

"Yeah. It would be great if you could do things like change the display refresh rate. Currently, for things other that windows, the display is at 64hz, for some reason. This makes everything slower and messier. Also, it seems that the graphics processor isn't being used, or if it is it's incredibly unclear (shows up as 'basic display adaptor'). Also the USB ports don't work. Even if you run windows but recognize it as ""other"" it makes it a much worse experience for literally the same OS from the same disk image, for no good reason."

To developers. Please improve process of importing macOS.app image. I've few downloaded app images for macOS, but when I try select it - it doesn't recongize file. I need move these files to the Applications folder and only then the Parallels recongines the images. And one more- it's not obvious that I need click onthe image to convert it to the bootable image. Please make this process more intuitive."

As I Linux professional who works from Macs and hates third party drivers and other kinds of binary code loaded into the kernel this software is almost like a steal. I have a mixed feeling about the fact that there is little to no reason to pay for this software since there is no reason to load Windows virtual machines. Perhaps you guys could add more features that Linux and OS X VMs could benefit from? Like

"Why should I choose to pay for Parallels Desktop Lite to use Windows VMs when I can do it for free using VirtualBox developed by Oracle ? Before downloading your app from App Store, I missed the line in the description which said Windows VMs need a paid subscription. If I didn't, I would never download it. and when I realized the payment requirement after the trial period, I quit your app immediately without trying.  I had checked the differences between Lite and Standart Version before downloading the Lite from App Store. And it had made sense why Lite is free and Standart is not. Standart has great features that I might consider paying for but Lite has no advantage over VirtualBox. If I remember correctly, you didn't have a Lite version at the beginning. and seeing this Lite version made me think that you wanted to gain popularity among the users who choose to use free Virtualbox  and don't try the Standart version. I am a developer and I can use Vagrant free version with VirtualBox but Vagrant is not free for Parallels. This also adds to the cost of Parallels Lite. As a summary, I may consider paying for Parallels Standart because of great features but will never pay for the Lite when its equivalent software is free."

I will try it again next year, but for now I will stick with VMWare Fusion."

"I’m on the free trial, and after a few attempts to get Windows 10 to install on the virtual machine, the application itself worked fine. The problem came in when the application began taking up almost all of my hard drive space. I tried unistalling the program and my virtual machine, but the hard rive size wouldn’t change. I spoke with a rep via chat and he sent me a link to a document to use, but the instructions didn’t match what was on my computer. Because of this, he referred me to Apple. After chatting with Apple and troubleshooting, they asked me to try a reboot and that worked.
First of all, the rep should be trained about rebooting the machine after uninstalling Parallels if that’s all it takes to clear it off. Second, there should be a warning about how much hard drive space you actually need to run it or strongly recommending an external drive because apparently a 500 GB internal hard drive isn't enough."

"That took me a long time to find out.  I guess the Lite version is good for the internet but not LAN.  Apparently, to do LAN you need to set the Network to Bridge/Default (form the parallels toolbar) and Lite doesn’t have that option.  You can tell the difference via ipconfig (in a cmd window) because if you’re using shared the default gateway won’t be the standard one (e.g. 192.168.1.1) bur rather something else (e.g. 192.168.64.1) which then can’t communicate with your other computers."
;

"Wouldn’t see other computers.  Noticted gateway not 192.168.1.1.  Manually changed that which broke everything (no internet access).  Changed it back. Everything still broken.  As per found item on forum, uninstalled then reinstalled parallel tools but then it suggested changing the Network for Shared to Bridged but no Bridged option is shown (bridged or host).  I guess tha was for a previous version.    I wanted to post on the forum but since Im in trial mode it won’t let me post.  So, that’s that. 
This is the perfect product to give you an enemy."

During this time, using the program and systematic paid updates, you can remain without pants.
Tentatively updated to 20,000 rubles. I didn’t count, but, probably, such an amount has already arrived, if not more, plus paid subscriptions. Today I have already bought 5 licenses (FIVE) Licenses, from the version of Parallels Desktop 6 for Mac to Parallels Desktop 10 for Mac. The decision of course to make you!

"tried to make a yosemite vm. 3rd try seemed to work but process far too buggy and erratic. will try full program and vm fusion to see if they work better and if my 2014 mbp 13 can handle it.
Retried this app based on an OS X article and it again failed to work for Yosemite.
Tried Parallels 14 and VM Fusion 10. Neither would handle a Yosemite VM but Fusion did pretty well on Windows 10. My personal impression is that despite laudatory Parallels 14 reviews, Fusion is a much better consumer product. It is also priced much better with 1 $80 license covering several macs by the same owner. Parallels requires 1 license per mac. Both products seem optimized for windows and not OS S versions.
Personally I am going to pass on virtualization as difficult, tricky and expensive."

"It is a very useful application. I would like there to be 64-bit Windows 7 drivers for Macbook Pro Retina Display (2016), since the Wi-FI network card does not work, but I can at least use Windows 7, which with the Apple application can be installed Windows 10 only."

"Neither in the description, nor on the site does it say that only Linux installation will be available. I don’t understand why it is impossible to install Windows with any minimal support? After all, there are free virtual machines that allow you to do this and at the same time quite high quality. For example, the same VirtualBox from Oracle. I wanted to see how it lives in Paralles, maybe I would move, maybe I would like some goodies and buy a paid subscription. But, apparently, not fate."

I'll be removing it now.

"Parallels Desktop Lite is a great alternative to the regular version of Parallels if you like me only want to run other free OS, such as Chrome OS, Linux, older versions of OS X ect, as someone who really only uses them for fun I am glad to have found a free version,
This app works perfectly for what it is, is easy and simple to use and has great features, all the features you could need."

"I have similar problem like one of the review. After using Parallels Desktop Lite I feel like I have problems to controll mouse. Controlling mouse by using touchpad was the best thing my MAC had. I liked it so much that I never wanted to use real mouse. Now, after using Parallels it all chenged. I am starting to hate it. I can’t point mouse pointer as easy and precise as earlier. I need to try couple of times only to hit the x when closing tab in Safary, for example.
Hopefully you will fix this soon."

"The Lite version has the limitation of not being able to install Windows, but only distro GNU / Linux. For me, it is enough. It performs very well in virtualization and there are no problems. I only put 4 stars because the price of the full version is exaggerated for a virtual machine program, where VirtualBox and VMware Player offer the possibility to virtualize (for free) even Windows without making subscriptions. At best it is better to pay the program without a subscription at a good price. I recommend the Lite version for those who want to use GNU / Linux on the Mac without doing a dual boot."

"I installed 4 Linux Mint distributions and not one was delivered ...

"I wanted to use ubuntu and installed it.
I tried using Parallels after a long time, but it is quite usable. I think it's fast enough for beginners.
Only one point.
If you move the mouse cursor to the Parallels side, the movement of the cursor will be explosive, and it will be a little faster even if you return it to the Mac side.
It will recover if you change the speed of the mouse cursor in System Preferences and then return to the original setting.
I hope it will be fixed in the next version upgrade."

"Since the free period was about to expire, I made an in-app purchase of 7400 yen and tried to get a one-year usage right.
I went through the screen and thought that I was able to purchase it at the App store safely using my ID PASS,
When I started Parallels Desktop Lite again, the plan selection appeared and I was requested to charge again. Otherwise the app will stop.
We also confirmed the billing by email from Apple, and confirmed that it was also debited from the credit card.
It's not a few hundred yen so I can't try it again and again.
What's going on.

"First of all, I’m thrilled I can get this through the Mac App Store. I like having updates centralized and knowning that the applications are sandboxed and have to “play nice,” but I never really expected virtualization software to be available here.
Parallels Desktop Lite runs my Linux VMs the fastest of any VM software I’ve used so far. The easy download and install function is great, and the default configurations are performant with relatively easy to understand machine settings. I primarily run it on a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro but my Linux VM even runs fairly well on my 2015 12” MacBook, which surprised me. Definitely recommend giving this one a go, especially if you are aiming to use a Linux distro as a guest OS (I have yet to try Windows, but I imagine it also performs well)."

"I consider parallels the best virtualization software, but considering that there are not some features and that is located on the mac app store, I believe that an appropriate price is € 24.99 per year and with updates included. In fact, with some promos it is possible to take the full version at 39.99. Why should I spend more? I personally downloaded it hoping that there will be some promos, in case I will buy the version here on the mac App Store: I prefer it because it updates automatically and because I can use it on more than one computer"

"The idea - great! Finally Parallels Desktop is also available in the official AppStore.
I thought that we would offer the users who use their Mac in private households the opportunity to use the program for a Windows installation cheaply.
Simply download - create and install Windows partition - done.
… it would be nice
Unfortunately, this lite version only offers you a subscription version of Parallels Desktop (or a free version to use Linux)
A subscription version is an absurdity for a private household that rarely uses Windows - Microsoft has the same problem with the 365 variant.
In my opinion, simply not practical for someone who does not use W10 or Office frequently.
So uninstalled right away.
- I want an inexpensive way to use Parallels (i.e. Windows) on my Mac. For my part, without these functions like ""Drag & Drap"" between Mac & W10."

"I used the 14 day trial to test this out, and was pretty impressed. It allows you to work seemlessly between mac and windows applications. I was impressed enough to upgrade to the annual subscription. This has not worked for me, and it appears that the only option is to purchase the full desktop package from the website, outside the app store. This is a more expensive product than quoted in the app, and means I need to manage the subscription separately. 
Not very impressed, and still deciding whether I want the hassle. 
I’m very supprised that I can not follow the upgrade model offered in the app, but from speaking to your online support there seems to be no way to resolve this issue."

"The two subscription plans offered are:

• TRIAL, which specifies 14 days of free use for virtualizing Windows, followed by a paid subscription.
The problem is, I don’t want to do either of those things. I want to virtualize Snow Leopard Server on a separate partition on my Mac (currently running El Capitan). Obviously, Parallels Desktop Lite can do this, because Snow Leopard Server is one of the operating systems listed. However, neither subscription option even mentions Mac OS virtualization. The user’s guide, knowledge base, and forums failed to be remotely helpful. So…
Can this application do what I need done? If so, which subscription plan is the correct one? If not, why is Snow Leopard Server listed? Honestly, the documentation leaves a lot to be desired as it only talks about virtualizing Windows. A little help?
EDIT: Thank you to the developer for answering my question! I’ll give it a try, then edit my review."

"Very good! The system was perfect. But I would like to know how do I increase the virtual memory (in the installation only 2gb is configured) to improve the performance of two programs that require a lot of RAM to be able to work without crashes. I mean Autodesk Inventor Pro and Revit. At first I noticed that this is with a lot of 'delay', making it impossible to perform the tasks. My equipment is an iMac 27 ”(2017), 3.5ghz, Fusion Drive of 1Tb and RAM of 8gb. I intend to do a memory upgrade (16gb), but I would still have to configure more virtual memory to avoid these crashes that do not occur on my Dell Vostro with 16gb RAM."

"Parallels is an amazing program. It’s unreal how easily it manages to allow you to run Windows programs on your mac. 
The problem that I have is with the licensing. 
Parallels Desktop Lite is missing quite a few features from the full version of Parallels, which is available outside the mac app store for a one-time purchase price of $79. However, that only gives you one license, so you can only use it on one computer. The nice feature of Parallels lite is that you can run it on all of your computers… but then you lose the features of the full version. 
They need to just make the full version available from the app store. Frankly, I don’t understand why they even created a “lite” version. The subscription is $69 a year, and I doubt most people are upgrading their full version of parallels every year…"

Just today I removed a log file of 40GB! That is completely unncecessary.
Then there’s the issue of restoring your license… I recently restored my mac to factory defaults, and now I have to be happy with the trial version I have as I’ve not been able to restore my license for the software. Guys, how hard is it? My purchase history is available on iTunes… why can I not restore it? 
Then there’s the problem of knowing exactly what your buying… I was under the impression Coherence would be included in my purchase, it was not, which was a big selling point for me… if I simply wanted something that could just run a virtual machine, I’d have gotten oracle virtual machine.
Still, even with all these gripes, a solid piece of software. Good work."

Turned Win10 and mired in terrible lags. For some reason, the system began to devour all the resources of the processor, although nothing was running except the bare OS.
Increased the resources allocated to VM, to no avail.
After a month of torment, I bought a subscription to Parallels Desctop 13 and the system flew. There are no lags, there are no drawdowns in resources, it opens very quickly after sleep.
Remained extremely upset by the Lite version"

The support consists of sending you nowhere and how to uninstall windows is either wrong or not current.
Have managed to uninstall all coponents now more by luck than support.
I bought a mac for a reason, what was i thinking putting windows on is.
This software may be very useful for some people and i can see the value of having two operating systems and in fairness it worked ok for the 2 hours i had it on, but every time i checked my hard disk space it had chewed up another GIG or so of memory."

Since you don't get very far via Apple Support, I have now described the whole thing with PayPal and frozen the payment.

"in many years I have tried and used many applications for virtualization, Parallels is, in my opinion, the best for MacOS ... BUT ... frankly I stopped spending 60 euros a year to have Windows virtualization. Might as well buy a PC from scratch and install it in a regular windows license, in the long run costs much less. Ok I am emphasizing (of course, on the PC I would not have the possibility of taking snapshots, for example, of the installation), but it would be better to make it pay less for this feature."

"I have run both Lite and the full edition on my 2017 iMac along with High Sierra and have decided to not stick with either variation of this app. The reason is basic. If you have less than 32 GIGs of RAM you could be in trouble, especially if you do graphics or large books.The RAM used by having two Operating systmes running at the same  time is excessive. Running 16 GIGs of RAM with both Systems running, your usable RAM will often drop to below 6 Gigs…that is with no other apps running! The app itself is spectacular, especially the full version! The support is very good, patient and quick to respond. The lite version is really good, but I’d strongly reccomend the full instead.
4/17/2018:
Support asked me if I had folloowed the RAM settings as suggested. I did and the RAM usage problem persists. I was not going to continue this review but now that I was asked let me continue. I had tremendous problems with the full version and High Sierra 10.13.4 utilizing Boot Camp on SSD. The app and Windows installed after a couple of problems were resolved. The real problem began after restarting from Windows back to the Mac partition. Restart resulted in a GRAY SCREEN on the Mac side. This could not be overcome despite much advise and help from Apple Support. Eventually the SSD had to be REFORMATTED, not just erased and had to return to Sierra 10.12.6 in order to install Windows 10 and Boot Camp. This saved a tremendous amount of RAM! And increased functionality! If you use High Sierra 10.13.4 I do not advise using Parallels and Windows 10 on an SSD. It could be a problem indigenous to my 2017 iMac…but all runs perfectly in Sierra 10.12.6!"

"Currently Parallels in the only virtualisation application in the Mac App Store. I’m very happy with the existence of virtualisation software in the Mac App Store, because it has to comply with the limitation that Apple requires from apps in their store. Therefore it cannot use kernal extensions, for example, which is important for system stability and security.
I’m wondering how well this app will be maintained. It has seen a few updates in the past year, so there seems to be at least some development efforts from the Parallels team. However, this version is hard to find on their website, so I’m sure it will get a lot less of their development attention than the regular Parallels program. 
At this moment, Parallels Desktop Lite has issues running Windows 10, as it’s writing error messages to a .log file multiple times per second, generating tremendously large log files (gigabytes within minutes). Parallels support team is unable to provide a solution and they are only willing to provide support via Remote Access for which you need to install LogMeIn Rescue (not available in the Mac App Store, so you need Administrator priviliges). This allows them to take-over your system to send your Virtual Machine to their servers, all of which bring alongs quite a few privacy concerns."

"very nice app. fully-functional FREE linux vm from app store. vm that doesnt need superuser rights! Everything works great with Ubuntu16 guest. Retina, Shared Folders, NATted network, USB...
The WORST thing - you cant do nested virtualization (not able to run KVM in guest) - thats why I move to vmware.
The second BAD thing is - you cant use command line tool prlctl with Parallels Lite :(
and my little question to Developers/Managers:  nested virtualization is disabled because of Lite or it is a technological/softwareissue?"

"By far, this is the best version of Parallels Desktop to suit my needs. There’s just one problem! DirectX 11 Support is missing, and without it, I can’t render 3D objects! PLEASE FIX IT!!
Update: As of the knowledge left in the developer’s response, which clearly states that OpenGL Compute Shaders (that the new macOS doesn’t support) is required to develop DirectX 11 support for virtual environments, I am officially sticking this one in Apple’s face by deleting the app, and getting a refund. However, what Apple doesn’t know is because that this issue is their fault, they’ll be taking the penalty, and NOT Parallels International GmbH.

However, similar to everyone elses post, this strikes me as an app which should be a one time pay instead of a subscription, especially when you could simply use disk utility to do what this offers. 60$ a month is not a good amount to expect for just the convenience of not reseting your computer and loading up windows."

"Follow the link ""Parallels Desktop Lite Support"" in the upper right corner,
In the FAQ, the answer to What are Parallels Desktop Lite system requirements? states only See KB123800.
Detailed operation requirements are written in the linked Knowledge Base article,
In the hardware requirements in it, there is a description ""Late 2011 or newer Mac"", that is, the Mac body of Late 2011 or later is required.
Certainly, Mac Pro and Mid 2010 do not work even if the OS is High Sierra, and it doesn't work, and Mid 2012 works.
It is not based on the hardware architecture, but based on the manufacturing year.
Perhaps the purpose is to eliminate the core 2 generation body uniformly, but
It's unreasonable that the architecture is almost the same in the Core i generation, and the CPU is Xeon, which is good at virtual processing, but it works with Mid 2012 of Mac Pro and does not work with Early 2009 and Mid 2010.
2018/Jan/07 Added
Thank you for your detailed answer.
I see, it is Apple's responsibility to prevent HyperVisor, which is the basis of this application, which is implemented in MacOS itself from operating in a main body of Late 2011 or later.
If there is a supplement for the operation requirements, could you also describe it in the app description on the App Store?

Offer a free product with such clumsy network configuration capabilities - maybe not? Better take the money, but for free I can use VirtualBox, there both NAT and the Internal network and shared with the network interface.

"While I don’t believe this to be worth $60 a year for adding Windows capability, the free availability with Linux only is a great plus! 
I was a full Parallels supporter for quite awhile, but when I stopped using Windows all together, I just switched to using VirtualBox for my linux needs.
After having issues with virtual box and how it deals with graphics on MacOS, I was pleased to find this software instead. It’s rarely talked about, and it’s powerful for Linux VMs on MacOS.
It’s not perfect though. Parallel Tools has issues when installing on newer Linux Distrobutions and the majority of the distrobutions that you can download straight from the application are extremely outdated. If the developers could update the software to just pull downloads from the most recent images of the distrobutions that they advertise, it would make this app a 5/5!"

"I thought this was going to be a great solution for a client who’s version of Parallels would not install due to High Sierra needing special permissions to load kernel extensions.
Parallels Lite popped up in my hours of Googling and I felt great relief. And it’s free! Oh wait no it’s not. These guys want $60/year to run non-Linux Virtual Machines. Very sad to see more vendors move to a subscription model instead of just selling you the software once.
Offer a one time price, we don’t want a subscription model!!!
Especially when the ""buy one time” version is coded where it will not install without special permissions for the KEXTs, but this one uses HyperVisor instead (read: coded to be properly compatible with macOS for the ideal user experience) and they hold you at a $60/year ransom to get the proper version."

Based on the experience of the past two years, this is actually not justified for the performance offered. Too often, Parallels Tools don't work and lag behind Linux development. The lite version will also be updated with a lot of delay.
Unfortunately VirtualBox has a poor performance and cannot be installed from the App Store. VMWare Fusion is as expensive as Parallels."

"I have new Mac with only USB-C ports. 
wanted to use this so i could run a game on steam that uses a controller... obviously had to use an adapter to for anyplug in devices... computer would not recognize or even register there was anything plugged in. on top of that, at start up, it even said there would be no wifi. also couldn't get sound to work through speakers. and for $80...thats total BS. Plus i had a key for windows and i never got to enter it...not sure what that was about. tried to transfer the windows via my microsoft account which is how it is supposed to work...and how they even recommended to do the set up... but without WIFI you cant even connect. Oh and through the adapter that is required to even use an Ethernet to hardline in... this wouldn't support (not an off-brand either).
and FYI, all of these things except the gaming controllers work no problem on the Mac side of things through the adapters. i only wanted this to play a game so i could use the controller.
I probably would have used the windows for other things too eventually...but then again... NOT for $80/year.
for that price: if anyone were gaming or using the windows more than a couple times a year.... you would be better off just spending the extra money to get a cheap PC laptop/desktop or even doing your own cheap build (the route i plan to take).

"On December 20, 2018, Corel took over Parallels. On January 21st, 2019 the first update appeared under the new owner. This version 1.4.0 abolished the free use for Linux virtual machines. After the update to version 1.4, a start screen welcomes you to enter a registration. Why do I have to register if an app-in purchase should also be possible via the Mac App Store?
The price of 79 € per year does not fit and represents a much too big leap from formerly free of charge. Fortunately, there are alternatives that offer your software free of charge or continue to be offered as purchase software. A license with no time limit is existential, because subscription software usually only works with the latest hardware and operating system and then you are quickly locked out.
If the new owner Corel acts so hard and does not think it is necessary to communicate this to the customers beforehand, there will be further unpleasant surprises in the future. This is no longer a partner for the common future. I have now uninstalled the program."

"As I was uncomfortable using Windows on my Mac during my free trial, I just bought a laptop for Windows.
I don't need Parallels, so I want to cancel before automatic payment, but there is no procedure.
I want to take action and delete it quickly to prevent automatic payment. What should I do?
I don't know if it's intentional, but other reviews like me have no reply at all, so I have nothing to refer to."

This application is waste of time even if distributers give us for free.

Edge has terrible memory leakes. Edge is a terrible browser.  It froze up parelells which then froze my macbook (next to impossible to achieve) for a long period of time and then it was a tricky mess to try and reboot the app while refreezing yet not crashing eveything. The app also stresses my hdd and  cooling fans when i'm multi tasking. I wish i didnt have to pay for the subscription seeing as how i am limited with capabilities due to the stress on my processor and memory and hdd

"What is a “LITE” version for if it costs as much as the standard version?
And then switch to a subscription model via update and without warning.
No thanks"""

"It's just a payment, but I can't update it.
Please tell me how to update
The developer answers are not correct, but there are no accounts and plans in the lite menu.
desktop 14 trial only
Developer seems to respond without knowing Lite menu
It's important that it was really well made, but sincere answers
I wish there was"

"When you open it, you need to buy it. There is no free Linux virtual machine. If you plan to use Linux for free, you don’t need to download it."

"Works fine in general and I prefer it to the other version that is not sandboxed and requires kernel extensions.
This version is  treated as a second tier product by the developer who would rather sell directly on their own site. The update frequency very low and the feature set is intentionally limited.
The support is just okay...
I reported a bug due to a conflict with another major product to Parallels that was acknowledged and put on the fix list for some time in likely never since this product is only updated once per year."

"I was using 1.3, but I clicked without hesitation because there was an update to 1.4.
When started, a dialog containing the words ""Free trial on 14th, then \9100/year"".
In the lower left corner, there was a [Restore Purchase], so I clicked ""I think so""
""""Parallels Desktop Lite.app"" is corrupted and cannot be opened. Please delete ""Parallels Desktop Lite.app"" and download it again from the App Store.""
Even if you delete it as it is said and install it again, you will not be able to proceed with the same message and the file cannot be opened.
If you click the [Buy] button in the lower left for a trial
Legal notes
""Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.""
...Is this ransomware? If you update, you will not be able to use the existing data unless you pay.
Those who currently use 1.3 on linux are advised not to update."

"I tried to install and a problem arose, I chose the forum as an attempt to solve. He is in English. To ask a question about the use and conditions of the acquisition did not work. It’s especially funny how they propose to enter a description of the question and make them read answers that are not nearly suitable. Will have to use other solutions. Very sorry. Expected more."

Perfect! I just want to know how much it will cost after 14 days of testing? What if you have a lifetime license?

The guest drivers do not compile under Linux (curently Ubuntu 19.4).  This product is very expensive and I don't understand why this is not tested.  I found somebody who had the same issue in January which is 5 month ago from now.  There is a workaround where I have to modify the sources a little bit.  This workaround fixed the issue but then it failed on another source file.  It's frustrating.  Luckily there is still Virtual Box.

"I think it's less than 14 days of free use, but it was paid today.
In addition, I left a post with technical support... No answer.
In my case, when I installed and used it for the first time, the computer's heat and fan rotated at high speed, and it was noisy and the processing speed was very poor.
I tried to use it all around, but the result was that it was not available on my MacBook.
Please cancel payment.
For reference, I tried to run the program after receiving the payment message.
Are you a fraud?"

"The previous version worked great, but this version crashes during virtual machine setup. I used to use the free tier for installing Linux and FreeBSD, which worked very well in the previous version. But this must-pay version crashes during virtual machine setup for FreeBSD. So, free = works and paid = broken."

"This is the first time I ever write a review, but this is absolutely the worst customer experience ever. This is what happens when companies that used to sell product change to a service model just because they can. Basic networking problems and I try to get help from the call center, but the person has not mastered the software or the english language. Paid for a year subscription. Cancelling today. I WANT A REFUND!!!"

"Parallels Lite used to run Linux guests for free, but that's no longer the case. You have to buy a paid subscription in order to do anything. This app should not be listed as ""free"" really."

"The best emulator, but to say that it’s free and make subscription mean :("

"This app used to be way better, because if you wanted to play around with Linux a bit it was free. Now I can understand that free isn't a good business model. But changing free to an €80 yearly subscription as the only option seems outright excessive for a casual Linux user like me. And besides that I would never use an app that uses the subscription model. Unfortunately no one time fee options offered so therefore it's time to delete this app."

"$80 a year to buy a lite version so I can spend hundreds more to buy windows? I can buy a cheap laptop at Costco for that price, with windows installed. Thanks but no thanks."

"I'm impressed you get people to pay so much for such a mediocre product when there are versions that are both good and free.
The product itself would be a solid three stars if it were free, but it's not and I can't see why anyone would bother buying this."

It reahed 30 mb then went down to 20, this happened a lot of ties then i kinda stopped downloading itself.

"As already a few others mentioned.. Not informing users that the upgrade to 1.4 is subscription based and not free anymore, is quite disappointing."

I have been trying to cancel this subscription and cannot. I followed the guide from the company faq that included pictures. When I got to the screen where the 'cancel subscrption' button is supposed to be there are only options for purchasing more subscriptions.  My subscription is listed as active and will expire may 19th but there's no way to unbsub.  That should give you an idea what kind of company this is.

"With the software from the manufacturer itself, I can use the software with my iMac Mid 2010 .. but not with the app. Find that kind of sad. What is this software for in the AppStore if you can load it anyway and also work with older devices?
Download the software from Parallels yourself and forget about the AppStore. The best example of non-functionality and exclusion in the AppStore."

Runs great! Easy to drag and drop files between systems.  It runs my appraisal software great.

"The application works very well, it is easy to install OS like windows 10 or Ubuntu 18.04, and you can work comfortably with the Mac OS desktop, in parallel.
-The downside is in the high price, € 80 a year, with an initial trial period of 14 days during which you are not charged.
There are free alternatives, at the cost of ease of use, but if you need to work with different OS this is an option to keep in mind."

"The developers are liars. They wrote that Linux and macOS virtual machines can be run for free for an unlimited amount of time. Now, without a subscription, 6,000 rubles a year does not start anything.
Unlimited amount of time! = 1 year"
