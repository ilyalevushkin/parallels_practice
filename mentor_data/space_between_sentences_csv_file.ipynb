The integration of the host OS and the VM is superb!  Copying/Pasting and sharing files is just easy.  Configuring your VM, tweaking RAM, adding CPUs, networking - is all done through a very intuitive GUI.  \\nOne favorite feature is being able to take snapshots of your VM in different states where you can revert back to a previous state if you later run into trouble.  Parallels Toolbox contains many surprisingly high quality utilities like freeing memory of the host OS, managing screen resolutions for my Retina display, cleaning the drive by removing large files and finding duplicate files.  \\nEngineering did an incredible job as this software is reliable and very intuitive.
