Anyone using the Cleaner scan? It wants permission to quite a few things in Security preferences and it bit worrying.
I am a new comer to Parallels after using Virtualbox and Bootcamp and it is so much easier to use. I test software installations in my role at work and create user guides and documentation. I was concerned it might be really slow but it is pretty responsive. 
All the best!"	4	Organic			en	http://parallels.com	Parallels	59d2350c0000ff0005ac982d

I use Fusion 360 for Mac OS (it's for 3d modelling and manufacturing) and Mach3 for Windows for operating of my CNC cutting machine. The main function of Parallels is to help me to use them together at the same time! Before it, I had to reboot computer every time to create new NC code for CNC.

Another feature was a running Windows from my Boot camp immediately after installation of Parallels, it was very easy to run."	5	Organic		Hey Kirill - Wow, thank you so much for sharing how you utilize virtualization to run your 3D modeling and machines. It is clear that you are truly a IT pro if you know how easy it is to import a Windows license from your existing Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine. We really appreciate your review here on TrustPilot for Parallels Desktop.

I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of installation and configuration.  I installed both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04 on my iMac-Pro, with Catalina.  Both worked flawlessly.  

The purchase process was painless, and intuitive.  Ubuntu, of course, is free and downloadable during the install.  Windows is also available to download, but I chose to purchase an OEM version online for $35.  Installing that was also simple and worked perfectly.  Support was available during and after the process, but was unnecessary for me.

So far, my only issue is the fact that it has to be upgraded Annually at a cost.  It’s not hugely expensive and I understand the need to keep current with changes to macOS.

This is a solid product and worth the expense.  I highly recommend it."	5	CopyPasteInvitation	222430795	Hey, Tom! Wow, you're truly a pro IT user of Parallels Desktop.

I still need access to Snow Leopard to run Macromedia FreeHand, an old but still highly respected PowerMac application, so that I can access years of archived FreeHand work at any time without having to constantly reboot the Mac into each OS. Despite FreeHand running under the Rosetta emulator in Snow Leopard and, in turn, Snow Leopard running under Parallels installed into High Sierra, performance is impressive and Parallels provides a highly efficient solution in this regard. 

Even with High Sierra running on an SSD formatted with the relatively new APFS file system, Parallels somehow manages to work some magic to ensure that this has no effect on Snow Leopard (which would not ordinarily be able to 'see' an APFS drive). Snow Leopard not only runs fine within Parallels on an APFS drive, but can also 'see' and access files and folders on that drive, which is impressive. 

Of course, you can similarly run Windows as a guest OS within Parallels on a Mac, which opens up a fantastic range of possibilities. All in all, I'm incredibly pleased with Parallels. For me, it does what it says on the tin far better than I had ever imagined would be possible. Highly recommended."	5	CopyPasteInvitation	22229589	Hey, Nigel!

Even if you don't need to run GNU/Linux, or Windows, or a miriad of other things - you can run different versions of OS X as virtual machines as well.
There are other ways of running Windows, GNU/Linux, and others on your Mac, but if you value your time, then Parallels is probably the quickest and easiest way to do it. For many guest OSs, setup is mostly automatic - you just set things like memory and disk sizes - and the setup wizard does nearly all the work for you.

After a MacOS update one of my virtual machines failed to start in Fusion. I spent a lot of time trying to trace the problem and couldn't get it fixed. In frustration I decided to try Parallels. I converted my virtual machines and they all worked. Not only that but I was able to run two virtual machines on an iMac at the same time. With Fusion if I ran the same virtual machines on the same iMac it would totally kill the performance of the two virtual machines and MacOS - it was unusable. Not only was Parallels giving me the virtual machine back running that Fusion wouldn't run, but it was also allowing me to run two virtual machines at the same time with no performance drop. So I am now a Parallels customer and I have no regrets. There have been no negatives.	5	FileUploadInvitation	212716607	Hey, Aaron! Thank you so much for such a kind review.

I was new to the mac and needed to transfer my windows skills but also needed a safe place where i could keep my essential windows apps. I wondered had i made the right choice so tried copies of all the other windows virtualisation software on the market. We are now on the 15th release which is a major rewrite, and provides the mac with a slew of utilities i mostly don't use, the reason is i had already bought into individual solutions form other suppliers. As time passes i find that i am switching to the parallels utils as a cheaper option when upgrade time comes along for the individual apps.
I still use windows XP for some apps and i still use mac mountain lion for others. To me, why throw away a really good utility just because the OS doesn't support it? just keep the old OS and the utility."	5	FileUploadInvitation	203461353	Hey Andy!

I previously used VMware Fusion but it didn't work as well and really slowed down my computer to the point I quit running windows on my Mac.

Both of my Windows virtual machines were preserved, fortunately. They run a little slowly, but both are legacy versions that won't be updating. The best new feature (to me) is the ability to create new virtual machines that run various flavors of Linux. This is a great learning tool.

Returning to the Parallels world, I've also installed Parallels Access and Parallels Toolkit. Both are easy and fun to use. It's a kick to control my laptop from my iPhone!

I highly recommend installing the latest version of Parallels Desktop fo Mac. If you must use applications that are only available for Windows, e.g. Microsoft Access or certain project management software, Parallels is the answer. The same would be true for Linux apps as well."	5	FileUploadInvitation	220142505	Hey, Randall! Wow, thank you so much for such a kind review of Parallels Desktop.

I use RHEL, CentOS, Windows, Mac OS X on my Laptop.  As a Senior Database Admin and Software engineer I work on US Gov't applications requiring high levels of security. 
Parallels allows me to run the same enterprise level software on my MacBook Pro where I can do research, generate documentation, write and test software and configure enterprise level systems in trial runs before going to Production, or when the work environment is inaccessible.  The integration of the host OS and the VM is superb!  Copying/Pasting and sharing files is just easy.  Configuring your VM, tweaking RAM, adding CPUs, networking - is all done through a very intuitive GUI.  
One favorite feature is being able to take snapshots of your VM in different states where you can revert back to a previous state if you later run into trouble.  Parallels Toolbox contains many surprisingly high quality utilities like freeing memory of the host OS, managing screen resolutions for my Retina display, cleaning the drive by removing large files and finding duplicate files.  
Engineering did an incredible job as this software is reliable and very intuitive.  I've not read a single line of documentation yet!"	5	FileUploadInvitation	219418239	Hey, Ruben!

So AccountEdge moved on to PC servers and Cloud only options we looked at several versions of software for extreme cost increases. Parallels saved the day and I installed Mojave and am running AccountEdge with no issues as always before. This may extend the life of our accounting software for years, especially at a time it took 2 months to resolve several other complications from the 149 other Applications when forced to a new Catalina system. Kudos to Parallels for such great help in making things simple.	5	FileUploadInvitation	217171245	Hey, Jeff.

For such a complex and powerful piece of software, it is comparatively easy to set up and I have virtual machines with windows XP and 10, plus older versions of Mac OS which I can launch easily, & without rebooting.
The 'Parallels Tools' for Mac is a great bonus too, adding powerful utilities to clean up my hard drive etc.
In my opinion, it is also great value for money!"	5	CopyPasteInvitation	213838762	Hey Daniel! We're so excited to read such a wonderful review of Parallels Desktop and Parallels Toolbox for Mac. Parallels Desktop has been the best solution to run Windows, Linux, and older macOS's on Mac without rebooting since 2006. We're also ecstatic that you're finding a great use for virtualizing older Mac OS X operating systems. With the release of macOS Catalina, there is no longer a native ability to run 32-bit Mac apps but with Parallels Desktop, virtualizing older Mac OS X systems is easy!

For years working in IT, Parallels has provided that bridge between MacOS and Windows that would otherwise involve portable storage (e.g. USB sticks), which is far from secure.

Running Parallels fixes that, meaning you can plug in an NTFS volume (external HD, USB stick etc) and write to it directly from MacOS (via a virtual 'shared' drive between OS'es), rather than being limited to Read-Only. This is a massive efficiency gain.

Parallels has meant I can continue to work in MacOS for the past 12+ years, despite being in Windows Enterprise environments. The added benefits of 'Snapshotting' my Windows installs also means I can use Parallels in a software testing environment, which runs the risk of corrupting a Windows install. Rolling back a snapshot in Parallels returns my 'guest' operating system back to a working state in a matter of minutes.

Nowadays I'm spending more time in photography, and I can use some specialist apps that are Windows only (such as Deep Sky Stacker for astrophotography) without having to transfer hundreds of images between a Mac and a PC.

Parallels has gone from strength to strength and is an integral part of my digital life."	5	Organic		Daniel, we are honored you've been such a loyal supporter of Parallels Desktop since version 3. You've outlined some wonderful use cases across multiple needs throughout your career.  We hope potential users will see your outstanding review and try Parallels Desktop for themselves.

I only needed some help with getting Windows setup as Parallels was pretty easy to follow. I also installed their Toolbox app. It has quite a few tools that I use daily (Capture Area is my favorite, Clipboard history is also nice, and Record Screen lets me save some of my favorite video clips from online). The only thing I wish Parallels included was a copy of Windows, which I didn't know I needed a license for (Easy enough to download from Parallels Desktop on setup), but my husband is an IT guy and took care of it for me. Definitely recommend Parallels for anyone using an Apple laptop, which a saying a lot since computer and me don't mix, but I'm slowly changing my mind.	5	ManualInputInvitation	13913988	Holly, thank you SO much for such a kind review.

I needed a VM environment on my new iMac using Catalina OS to house an old '2007 Quicken for Mac' program in an El Capitan OS.  I did not want to abandon 16 years of data to try to fit into (or misfit) the latest Quicken App.  I found that on the whole, it is doing what I need to continue to add data to the App.  I'm living with some peculiar issues such as that I no longer be able to use Quicken's native backup.  Every time I do, I lose recently entered data.  I conclude after working with Quicken experts that it might be a Quicken problem that they no longer support.  So I just rely on Disk backup on the Mac.  Hoping that is adequate.  Then there is the issue of shutting down Parallels.  I found that if I shut down the VM, I will lose data in Quicken as well.  So I must do no more than  minimize or suspend Parallels, when I turn off the computer.  It give me pause when recently Parallels offers an update.  Should I shut down the VM and risk losing data for the update?  I'm learning to live with the corkiness of the situation.  By the way, their tech support is great, very responsive and knowledgable.	4	FileUploadInvitation	206796487	"Hey Ken! Quicken releases major updates at least once a year and minimal/smaller updates usually once every 3-4 months so we try our best to implement updates within Parallels Desktop for these changes.

I had Windows 7 and so I needed to, but I hope that Parallels can get faster on Windows 10. I have a relatively new and fast computer - an iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017), 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7, 40 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 of RAM - this should not be acceptable. I hope future upgrades to Parallels improves this. Thanks for asking.	5	FileUploadInvitation	204252846	Hey Steven! I'm going to have a support engineer reach out to you as soon as possible. Microsoft encouraged most Windows 7 users to move to Windows 10 due to Win7 EOL but we've had hardly any support tickets related to the performance of Windows 10. We've had most users tell us their performance is better on Windows 10. Because of this, I'll make sure the support engineer reaches out as soon as possible to optimize your virtual machine performance.

I further sent screen grabs of me signed into my College and also an e-mail from my Tutor form that week about that week's lesson.
They then sent an e-mail saying I was not eligible as had exceeded upload limit. 
Why bother with a student discount if you do not want to honour it for half of these people.
